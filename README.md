# Zip Game

A puzzle game inspired by LinkedIn's Zip game where players must create a continuous path through a grid, connecting numbers in sequential order while filling every cell.

## Game Rules

- **Objective**: Create a single continuous path that passes through each number in order (1 → 2 → 3 → ... → N)
- **Constraint**: Your path must fill every cell in the grid exactly once
- **Movement**: Move horizontally or vertically between adjacent cells
- **Challenge**: Navigate around barriers and obstacles while maintaining the sequence

## Features

- Daily puzzle challenges
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Interactive grid-based gameplay
- Score tracking and leaderboards
- Hint system for challenging puzzles
- Multiple grid sizes and complexities

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zip-game.git
cd zip-game
```

## Requirements

- [List your dependencies here - e.g., Python 3.8+, Node.js 14+, etc.]
- [Any other libraries or frameworks]

## Usage

```bash
# Start the game
[Your command here]

# Example:
# python main.py
# npm start
# java -jar ZipGame.jar
```

## How to Play

1. Launch the game
2. Examine the grid and identify all numbered cells
3. Click or drag to create a path starting from 1
4. Continue connecting each number in sequence
5. Ensure your path fills every cell in the grid
6. Complete the puzzle before time runs out (if applicable)
