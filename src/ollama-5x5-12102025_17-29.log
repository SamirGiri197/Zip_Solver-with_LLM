Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:29:39,117 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2) and I've filled 1 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in a continuous path, starting from clue number 1 and ending at the highest numbered clue. Clue 2 is located at position (0,3). Since I'm already on top of clue 1, my next move should be towards clue 2.

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue 2, which means moving to position (0,3).

EVALUATION:
I have three available moves: (1,2), (0,1), and (0,3). Let's evaluate each option:

* Moving to (1,2) would take me away from the top row where clue 2 is located. It doesn't seem like a good choice.
* Moving to (0,1) would put me one step away from clue 2, but it also creates an empty cell between clues 1 and 2.
* Moving directly to (0,3), which is towards clue 2, seems like the most direct path.

DECISION:
The best move is to move directly towards clue 2, since I'm already on top of it. This keeps me in a straight line with the next few clues and allows for easier planning of future moves.

I am currently at position (0,3) and have filled 2 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located somewhere on the board. However, I don't know its exact location yet.

STRATEGY:
Since I'm already at a clue (clue 2), I should look for the next one in ascending order. In this case, clue 3 would be the next logical choice to visit.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

Option 1: Move to (1,3)
Pros: This move gets me closer to the top-left corner of the board, which might provide more information about the location of future clues.
Cons: It doesn't seem to bring me any closer to clue 3.

Option 2: Move to (0,4)
Pros: This move fills an empty cell and provides some flexibility for future moves.
Cons: It's not clear how this move will help me reach clue 3 or progress towards the goal of filling all cells in one continuous path.

DECISION:
I choose to move to (1,3) because it gets me closer to the top-left corner of the board, which might provide more information about the location of future clues. This is a strategic move that sets me up for potential future moves towards clue 3 and the rest of the puzzle.

2025-12-10 17:29:57,277 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 17:29:57,277 - INFO - Here are my step-by-step solutions:

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) with 3/25 cells filled, having visited clues 1 and 2. The next clue to visit is clue 3, which should be located at a new row or column.

MOVE: (2,3)

THINKING:
From my current position (1,3), I can move to either (0,2) by going back one row or (1,4) by moving right. Since the next clue is supposed to be in a new location and we're already on a relatively low-numbered column (column 3), it's more likely that the next clue will be in a higher row rather than just incrementing the column number.

MOVE: (2,0)

THINKING:
Now I am at position (2,0). The next possible moves are to move up one cell (1,0), down one cell (3,0), or right two cells to reach the location of clue 4 (3,2) directly. However, it's likely that clue 4 will be above clue 5 and not on the same column as clue 3, so moving down would also work.

MOVE: (3,1)

THINKING:
From position (3,1), we have four possible next moves: move up one cell to (2,1) to get closer to clue 4, or move right to reach clue 5. Moving up gets us closer but doesn't block any paths; moving down might be useful if the last few clues are clustered together at the bottom of the board.

MOVE: (3,0)

THINKING:
Now I'm at position (3,0). The only next possible move is to go right one cell to get to the first column with clue numbers and potentially reach higher numbered clues. 

MOVE: (4,1)

I am currently at position (2,3) with a filled path of (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3), having visited Clues 1 and 2. My goal is to continue the path in ascending order while ensuring I fill all empty cells between clues as needed.

STRATEGY:
Next, I need to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (0,4). However, there are two paths that can lead me to this clue: either by going horizontally or vertically from my current position. Since I'm at the bottom-right edge of the board with a filled cell, it's essential to consider both options and their impact on future moves.

EVALUATION:
Available Next Moves:

* (3,3): Moving diagonally up-left from my current position is not an option according to rule 5.
* (2,2): This move doesn't get me closer to Clue 3 at (0,4) and could potentially block future paths or make it difficult to reach the upper left corner of the board.

MOVE:
(3,3) is not a valid diagonal move. Since I need to keep moving in ascending order, visiting the next available clue makes sense. The only other option that gets me closer to Clue 3 is (2,4).

2025-12-10 17:30:17,653 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (3,3) with a filled path of (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). This means I have already visited clue 1 and clue 2, which are located at positions (0,2) and (0,3), respectively. My goal is to visit all clues in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited clue 2, the next clue I need to visit is clue 3. Unfortunately, there is no direct clue number given for its location, but it must be somewhere on the board.

3. EVALUATION:
Let's examine the available moves: (4,3), (3,2), and (3,4).

*   **(4,3)**: This move would take me out of the current row and try to reach towards a higher numbered clue which is not yet clear about its position in the puzzle so it might be too early for this decision considering the order of clues. It also doesn't seem like it will lead directly to clue 3.
*   **(3,2)**: This move would allow me to potentially visit clue 3 if it's indeed located at this or a nearby position. However, without knowing the exact location of clue 3 yet, I might be taking an unnecessary risk by moving away from the current path.
*   **(3,4)**: Since we don't know where the next clue is and there are still empty cells between my current position and (0,2) as per the clue locations mentioned earlier in the game state, this move could put me out of line with a potential future clue location but it also leaves us possibilities that might open up in our favor.

**DECISION:**
Based on the analysis above, I would choose **(3,4)**. This move keeps me close to my current path and doesn't commit to a specific direction without knowing the next clue's exact position. It gives me flexibility for future moves while minimizing potential risks. However, it also means that there is still an empty cell between (0,2) and (0,3) which might not be the best use of available space considering we want to make continuous path as per the rules.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,4) with a path that has already visited clue 1 (0,2), clue 2 (0,3), and several intermediate cells. The goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path while following the rules.

2. STRATEGY: Next, I need to visit clue 3, which is not shown on the current board state but will be at position (1,4).

3. EVALUATION:

Available next moves are (2,4) and (4,4). 

- Moving to (2,4): This move would get me closer to the left edge of the board, potentially setting up a path towards clue 3 at (1,4), but it doesn't immediately lead me into the sequence of clues.
  
- Moving to (4,4): This position is already on the right end of my current path and does not advance towards any future clues in an efficient manner. It could be a stepping stone for further moves if they align with finding the next clue.

4. DECISION: Given the need to visit clue 3 efficiently and maintain progress towards the left edge (to eventually reach all clues), moving to (2,4) is the optimal choice. This move sets up potential paths that can lead directly or indirectly to subsequent clues while also exploring more of the board's left side.

2025-12-10 17:30:36,571 - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,4) with a path that has already visited clue 1 (0,2), clue 2 (0,3), and several intermediate cells. The goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path while following the rules.

2. STRATEGY: Next, I need to visit clue 3, which is not shown on the current board state but will be at position (1,4).

3. EVALUATION:

Available next moves are (2,4) and (4,4). 

- Moving to (2,4): This move would get me closer to the left edge of the board, potentially setting up a path towards clue 3 at (1,4), but it doesn't immediately lead me into the sequence of clues.
  
- Moving to (4,4): This position is already on the right end of my current path and does not advance towards any future clues in an efficient manner. It could be a stepping stone for further moves if they align with finding the next clue.

4. DECISION: Given the need to visit clue 3 efficiently and maintain progress towards the left edge (to eventually reach all clues), moving to (2,4) is the optimal choice. This move sets up potential paths that can lead directly or indirectly to subsequent clues while also exploring more of the board's left side.

**THINKING:**
1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,4) with a filled path of 7/25 cells.
The current path is: (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4)
Looking at the board, I see that I have visited clue numbers 1 and 2, which are located at positions (0,2) and (0,3), respectively.

2. STRATEGY:
My next move should aim to visit clue number 3, which is not yet in my path.
According to the rules, I need to visit all clues in ascending order, so my goal for this step is to reach position (0,4).

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (1,4) from (2,4) would take me closer to clue 3 but might limit future paths due to the current board state.

**DECISION:**
I choose to move to (1,4) because it gets me closer to my next destination and allows for more flexibility in future moves.

MOVE: (1,4)

- Move to (2,4) or any other direction is blocked by filled cells.

4. DECISION:
Considering the pros and cons, moving to (0,4) seems like a better option as it gets me closer to clue 3 without blocking any future paths.

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (0,4) with a filled path of 9/25 cells. The current state of the board shows that I've visited clue 2 and moved horizontally to (0,4).
2. **STRATEGY:** Next, I need to visit clue 3, which is located at position (1,2). However, since my current path doesn't directly lead me to clue 3, I must find a way to reach it while maintaining the continuous path.
3. **EVALUATION:**
	* Moving back up to (0,2) would get me closer to clue 3 but might create a problem if I have to revisit (0,3).
	* Going down to (1,4) or (2,4) doesn't bring me any closer to clue 3.
	* Staying at the same row and moving left or right is not an option since it wouldn't help me reach clue 3 directly.
4. **DECISION:** Considering the constraints and the need to maintain a continuous path, I should move up one row and two columns to the right, which will allow me to approach clue 3 while keeping my options open.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 17:31:09,637 - INFO - Here are my step-by-step solutions:

**THINKING 1:**
I am currently at position (0,4) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is at position (1,2). From my current position, I can move to (0,3), (0,5) (which is not within the board), or stay put.

**MOVE:** (0,3)

**THINKING 2:**
I've moved to position (0,3) and filled another cell. Now, I need to visit clue 4 next, which is at position (1,2). However, there's a constraint - I'm stuck because I can't move left or up without revisiting a cell. From my current position, I can only move right.

**MOVE:** (0,4)

Wait, this isn't correct as we already know the position (0, 4).

**THINKING 3:**
I've moved to position (1,3) from (0,4). I need to visit clue 3 next, which is at position (2,2). However, there's no direct path. Clue 5 is located at (2,3), and then I have two paths that will lead me to (1,4) or (3,2).

**MOVE:** (2,3)

**THINKING 4:**
I've moved to position (2,3). Now, I need to visit clue 5 next. Clue 6 is located at (2,4), but there's an empty cell between them, which could be filled if necessary.

**MOVE:** (2,4)

**THINKING 5:**
I've moved to position (2,4). Now, I need to visit clue 7 next. There are no direct paths to the clue locations that haven't been visited yet.

**MOVE:** (3,2)

2025-12-10 17:31:20,109 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,4) with 9 cells filled out of 25. Looking at my path taken so far, I've visited clues 1 and 2, which are located in positions (0,2) and (0,3), respectively. The next clue to visit is clue 3, but it's not directly accessible from here without revisiting a cell or going out of bounds.

From the current board state, there are no available moves that allow me to proceed to the next clue without violating one of the rules (revisiting a cell, diagonal move, or moving out of bounds). This indicates that I'm "stuck."

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that my progress so far has filled up the first row and left an empty path for the second row. To continue making progress, I should focus on filling in the second row.

**STRATEGY:** The next clue to visit is indeed Clue 3. However, since there are no direct paths to it from (0,4), I'll need to find a way to get into the second row and then navigate towards the third row where Clue 3 is located.

**EVALUATION OF MOVES:**

- Moving horizontally or vertically within the same row doesn't help as we've reached the end of that row.
- Considering moving down to (1,4) or (2,4) would not directly get us closer to clue 3 in a way that allows us to continue in ascending order.

**DECISION:** The best move seems to be backtracking slightly but getting into the second row where we can then plan our next steps. We need a cell that's part of the path and is at or below the current position (0,4).

MOVE: (1,3)

This move allows us to fill an empty cell in the path while positioning ourselves for further progress by moving closer to the potential area where Clue 3 could be approached in ascending order.

I am currently at position (4,2) and have filled 1 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,4). From my current position, I have three available moves: (3,2), (4,1), or (4,3).

STRATEGY:
My goal is to reach clue 2, and I should move towards it. Clue 2 is located in the bottom-right corner of the board, so any move that takes me closer to this position would be beneficial.

EVALUATION:
Let's evaluate each available move:

1. (3,2): This move takes me two rows down from my current position. I would then be only one row away from clue 2. However, I might need to revisit the same row later, as there are still empty cells between clues.
2. (4,1): This move takes me one column to the left of my current position. While it gets me closer to the bottom-right corner, it doesn't take me directly towards clue 2.
3. (4,3): This move takes me one column to the right of my current position. Similar to (4,1), it gets me closer to the bottom-right corner but not directly towards clue 2.

DECISION:
Given the options, moving to (3,2) seems like the most direct and efficient choice. It brings me closer to clue 2 while also keeping me on a path that will eventually take me through all clues in ascending order.

I am currently at position (3,2) with a filled path length of 2/25 cells. I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,4). My current position provides three possible moves: (2,2), (3,1), and (3,3).

EVALUATION:

* **(2,2)**:
	+ Pro: This move gets me closer to the right edge of the board, where clue 2 is located.
	+ Con: It doesn't directly help with visiting clue 2 next.
* **(3,1)**:
	+ Pro: This move brings me closer to the left edge of the board and opens up potential future paths.
	+ Con: It might not be the most direct route to visit clue 2 next.
* **(3,3)**:
	+ Pro: This move allows me to maintain my current row and explore other possibilities for visiting clue 2 later on.
	+ Con: However, it doesn't directly contribute to progressing towards clue 2.

DECISION:
Considering the pros and cons of each available move, I choose **(2,2)** as the optimal next step. This move gets me closer to the right edge of the board, which is where clue 2 is located. It also opens up potential future paths for visiting other clues and doesn't block any possible routes.

2025-12-10 17:31:44,829 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,2) with 3 out of 25 cells filled. My current path is from clue 1 at (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2). I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at (3,4).

STRATEGY:
The next clue I should visit is clue 2 at position (3,4). This clue is in a higher row than my current position and requires me to move up.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (1,2) would get me closer to the vertical direction needed to reach clue 2, but it's not directly towards the goal.
* (2,1) would move me away from the column needed to reach clue 2 and could potentially create a dead-end in the future.
* (2,3) is horizontally adjacent to my current position and allows me to continue moving vertically.

DECISION:
Since I need to visit clue 2 at (3,4), which requires moving up, I should choose a move that gets me closer to the vertical direction. The most straightforward choice would be to move right to (2,3) as it keeps my options open for future moves and doesn't create an immediate dead-end.

2. **STRATEGY:** I need to visit the next clue in ascending order, which is Clue 2 at position (3,4). However, it's not directly accessible from my current position.
3. **EVALUATION:**
	* Move (1,3): This move gets me closer to Clue 2 but still doesn't allow me to visit it directly. It might be a good intermediate step, but I need to consider the path ahead.
	* Move (3,3): This move puts me on the same row as Clue 2, which is a good starting point for visiting it next. However, I'm also blocking potential paths on this row.
	* Move (2,4): This move doesn't seem very promising as it takes me away from my current path and doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2.

2025-12-10 17:32:02,329 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,3) with 4 out of 25 cells filled. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,4). To get there efficiently and avoid revisiting cells or getting stuck, I'll evaluate each available move.

STRATEGY:
I should aim for clue 2 at position (3,4) as it's the next logical step in my path. Visiting clues in ascending order will help me fill empty cells between them as needed.

EVALUATION:

1. Move to (1,3):
	* Pros: Moves diagonally down and right from my current position.
	* Cons: Might not get me closer to clue 2 immediately; could lead to revisiting or blocking paths later.
2. Move to (3,3):
	* Pros: Moves directly towards the potential next move towards clue 2 if I decide on a diagonal path after this one.
	* Cons: Not as direct a step as moving down from my current position would be.
3. Move to (2,4):
	* Pros: Moves right and opens up possibilities for future paths but doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 immediately.
	* Cons: Might lead to revisiting cells or create unnecessary backtracking.

DECISION:
Considering the need to visit clue 2 next and maintain a path that allows flexibility for filling empty cells, moving to (3,3) seems the most direct and forward-thinking choice. It sets me up well for either continuing down towards clue 2 if I decide on a diagonal or straight path after this move.

Considering the need to visit clue 2 next and maintain a path that allows flexibility for filling empty cells, moving to (3,3) seems the most direct and forward-thinking choice. It sets me up well for either continuing down towards clue 2 if I decide on a diagonal or straight path after this move.

2025-12-10 17:32:12,155 - INFO - Here are my steps:

**THINKING 1: ANALYSIS**
I am currently at position (3,3) with a progress of 5/25 cells filled. The current path taken is (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). I have already visited clue 1 and need to visit the next clue in ascending order.

**STRATEGY**
The next clue number I should visit is Clue 2. According to the Clue Locations, Clue 2 is located at position (3,4).

**EVALUATION: AVAILABLE MOVES**
I have two available moves:
1. (4,3)
2. (3,4)

**MOVE 1**
Considering my current position (3,3) and the need to visit Clue 2 at (3,4), I realize that moving to (3,4) would directly take me to Clue 2, fulfilling the next clue requirement.

THINKING:
Moving to (3,4) is a straightforward choice as it aligns with my goal of visiting the next highest numbered clue in ascending order. It also doesn't block any future paths and keeps the path continuous.

MOVE: (3,4)

**UPDATE BOARD STATE**

  .    .  [ 2] [ 5]   6 
  .  [ 1]   .    8 

**PROGRESS: NEXT STEPS**
Next, I need to visit Clue 3 and continue filling the path in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order and the next clue number should be higher than 2, I need to find clue number 3. According to the board information, clue locations are given only for clues 1 and 2. We don't know where the next clues will be.

3. EVALUATION: Considering the available moves (2,4) or (4,4), we need to evaluate their pros and cons.
- Move (2,4): This move allows us to fill in more cells as needed between clues, following rule 7. However, it doesn't bring me closer to any known clue number yet. We have no information about where clue 3 will be located. 
- Move (4,4): Since I am currently at position (3,4), moving to (4,4) would allow us to fill the last required space for a clue before visiting it but does not bring me closer to any specific number clue yet. In fact, this might block other potential future paths if we have to go back.

4. DECISION: Between these two options, neither move gets me closer to any specific clue number (since there's no direct information about their locations), so I choose the one that provides more flexibility in terms of moving around and filling empty cells between clues as needed.

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I'm currently at position (1,4), which is indicated by the number 8 in the visual board state. I've filled 8 out of 25 cells so far.

2. **STRATEGY:** My next goal is to visit clue 3, which is located at position (3,3). However, since we don't have a direct clue to follow from here on, we should consider visiting clues in order while filling the remaining empty cells.

3. **EVALUATION:**

Available Next Moves:

* (0,4): This move would take me out of the main path and potentially create a loop. It's not an ideal choice.
* (1,3): This move allows us to visit clue 2 first before reaching clue 3, which is a good strategy.

**DECISION:** Given that we need to visit clues in order and considering the available moves, I'll choose the move that sets up our path for visiting clue 2 next.

I am currently at position (1,4) with 8 out of 25 cells filled. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once. I need to continue my path in ascending order of clue numbers.

STRATEGY:
My next clue to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (3,4). However, I am already at a higher row than the Clue 2 location, so I can't move directly to it without revisiting cells. Instead, I need to fill in the empty cells between my current position and Clue 2.

EVALUATION:
My available next moves are (0,4) or (1,3). Let's evaluate each option:

* Moving to (0,4):
	+ Pro: Fills an empty cell.
	+ Con: Doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2 and might make it harder to visit subsequent clues.
* Moving to (1,3):
	+ Pro: Brings me one row closer to Clue 2 and opens up potential paths for future moves.
	+ Con: Requires careful consideration of the path's direction to avoid revisiting cells.

DECISION:
Considering my goal is to fill all 25 cells in a continuous path while visiting clues in ascending order, I choose to move to (1,3). This option brings me closer to Clue 2 and provides more flexibility for future moves.

2025-12-10 17:33:03,726 - INFO - Here are my steps to solve the ZIP PUZZLE:

**Step 1**

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) with a path of length 10. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and fill all empty cells between clues as needed. My current situation is that I have already visited Clue 1 and I'm now looking for the next clue number to visit.

**STRATEGY:**
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (3,4). However, since my current position is not adjacent to (3,4), I need to choose a move that gets me closer to this location while also considering the empty cells between clues.

**EVALUATION:**
For each available move:
- Moving to (0,2) would take me away from Clue 2 and create a gap in my path.
- Moving to (1,1) is not directly adjacent to Clue 2 but does bring me closer to the location without blocking any potential future paths.

**DECISION:**
Considering my current position and the next clue number I need to visit, the best move from the available options is:

MOVE: (0,2)

**Step 2**

THINKING:
After making the move to (0,2), my new path length becomes 11. Now that I'm at this location, I can see that it's actually adjacent to Clue 1 and there are empty cells in between where I need to fill some numbers.

**STRATEGY:**
My next goal is to get to Clue 2, which is still located at position (3,4). To achieve this efficiently without creating a gap or blocking potential future paths, I need to think about the most direct route while also considering filling empty cells between clues.

**EVALUATION:**
For each available move from my current location:
- Moving back up to (1,2) might seem appealing but would not get me closer to Clue 2.
- Staying at (0,2) allows me to explore moving horizontally towards Clue 2 without blocking potential future paths.

**DECISION:**
Considering the new situation and my goal of reaching Clue 2 efficiently, I decide to:

MOVE: (0,1)

Please let me know when you're ready for me to proceed with the next step.

2025-12-10 17:33:03,741 - INFO - I am currently at position (1,2) with a path of length 10. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and fill all empty cells between clues as needed. My current situation is that I have already visited Clue 1 and I'm now looking for the next clue number to visit.

**STRATEGY:**
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (3,4). However, since my current position is not adjacent to (3,4), I need to choose a move that gets me closer to this location while also considering the empty cells between clues.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:33:13,354 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 17:33:13,355 - INFO - Here's my solution:

THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2) with 11 out of 25 cells filled. My current path is: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (0,2). My next move should get me closer to the remaining clues.

STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is Clue 2 at position (3,4), but since it's already been visited in my current path, my next goal is to move towards the right side of the board where Clue 3 and other unvisited cells are located. However, as per the given available moves, I can only choose between moving left or right.

EVALUATION:
Available Move (0,1): This move would take me away from the potential paths that could lead to higher numbered clues on the right side of the board.
Available Move (0,3): This move gets me closer to the empty cells on the right-hand side and might provide a future path towards Clue 3 or other unvisited cells.

DECISION:
Considering I need to maintain flexibility for my future moves and considering that there are many clues left to be visited on the right side of the board, moving (0,3) seems more strategic. This move doesn't block any potential paths but keeps me in a position where I can explore the right side of the board.

MOVE: (0,3)

Please let me know if this is correct and we can proceed further with the puzzle!

2025-12-10 17:33:33,222 - INFO - Here's my analysis:

THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,4) with 13/25 cells filled, indicating I've made some progress. My current path is: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4). The next clue I need to visit is clue 3, which is located at position (3,2), but it's not available as the path taken so far doesn't allow for this move. However, clue 3 is in the way of visiting any other unvisited clues. My only option now seems to be moving back and filling empty cells.

Given my current situation, I need to find a safe path that allows me to visit subsequent clues without revisiting any cells or going out of bounds. Since I've already visited all adjacent positions except (0,1), I'll start by trying to move towards (0,2) from the current position, but it's blocked because I'm on the edge and there are no empty cells between clue 1 at (4,2) and my current position.

Evaluating other options:
- Moving up to (1,4) is not possible as it would take me out of bounds.
- Moving down to (3,4) or (4,4) doesn't help since I'd be moving away from clue 3.
- Moving left to (0,3), but that's already part of my path.

Considering the grid layout and available moves, a more optimal choice would be to move up to (1,4), then try to navigate through. However, this doesn't seem feasible given the constraints.

Another option is moving right from (0,4) towards an empty cell or clue 3's position but that seems too far away considering I'd have to backtrack later. The best possible move under these conditions would be trying to fill adjacent cells while keeping in mind future paths for clues.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

I am currently at position (0,4) with 13/25 cells filled. My path so far is long and winding, but I need to find a way to visit all clue numbers in ascending order. The next clue to visit is Clue 3, which is not yet located on the board.

To determine where Clue 3 might be, I look for empty spaces between the current position (0,4) and the previous visited clues. I also consider how visiting each available move would affect my future path.

Available moves from (0,4) are: (1,4), (0,3), or staying at the same position. However, since we need to visit Clue 3 next and it is not on the current row or column of the board yet, I'll try moving towards the right where there is more empty space.

2025-12-10 17:33:48,133 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,4) with 13 cells filled out of 25. My current path is quite long, and I need to visit clue 3 next. However, there's a problem: clue 2 is located at position (3,4), which is the same column as my current position! Since I've already visited this clue, I cannot revisit it.

Upon analyzing the board, I notice that I'm stuck in the top-right corner of the board. My goal now is to find a way out of this area and continue with the rest of the path.

Looking ahead, I see that there's an empty cell at position (1,4) between clue 2 and my current position. Visiting clue 3 would require me to move into the main body of the board.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed Clue 3. However, since I'm stuck in this area, I need to find a way out first. One possible option is to fill an empty cell and then make my way towards Clue 3.

EVALUATION:
Available moves from the current position (0,4) are:

* Move up: not possible as it would lead me back into an already visited area
* Move left: not possible since there's a solid wall of filled cells between us
* Move down: I could move to (1,4), but that doesn't get me closer to clue 3

DECISION:
Considering my options, moving up is the only viable choice at this point. However, I must revisit and modify it.

I moved to position (1,4) which blocks further path to Clue 2

From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:34:03,012 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) with 2/25 cells filled. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from clue 1, which is located at position (2,0). From my current position, I can move up or down or left or right. The available next moves are: (1,1), (3,1), and (2,2).

STRATEGY:
The next clue to visit is Clue 2, which is not directly connected to the current position.

EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

* Move (1,1): This move gets me closer to Clue 2, which I need to visit next. It also leaves options for future moves.
* Move (3,1): Moving down would take me away from the path towards Clue 2 and might limit my options for future moves.
* Move (2,2): While this move does not block any paths immediately, it takes me slightly further away from the direct path to Clue 2.

DECISION:
The most logical next step is to move up one row and one column, which gets us closer to the ascending order of clues. This will keep future options open for visiting all other clue numbers without restriction or obstruction.

2025-12-10 17:34:09,796 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

**Step 1**

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1) with a filled path of length 3. The highest numbered clue is still 4, which is not yet visited. I have available moves: (0,1), (1,0), or (1,2). Looking ahead, I want to visit the next clue in ascending order.

The current clue order is: 1 -> 2 -> 3
I need to visit clue 2 next.

**Move**

MOVE: (1,0)

**Explanation**
Since my current position is at (1,1) and I'm adjacent to it, moving left to (1,0) gets me closer to the next clue, which should be at a lower or same row as mine. Considering the clue order and board layout, visiting clue 2 at (3,2) is one of the shortest paths.

The path taken so far: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)

Please let me know if this move is correct or not!

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 17:34:33,608 - INFO - THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 6 out of 25 cells. My current path is (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1). I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number I should visit is 3. It's located at position (4,3).

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, I will consider the pros and cons:
- Moving to (0,2) would take me further away from clue 3.
- However, it does leave an empty space between clues 1 and 2, which could be useful later in the path.

4. DECISION: While moving to (0,2) doesn't seem like the most direct move, considering future implications might make it a better choice than I initially thought.

MOVE: (0,2)

Now that we've moved to position (0,2), let's reassess our situation:

THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: We are now at position (0,2) and have filled 7 out of 25 cells. The path is still (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2). We need to continue visiting clue numbers in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: Clue 3 is still our next target, located at position (4,3).

3. EVALUATION: With the new move to position (0,2), we have more options for reaching clue 3:
- Moving up would take us towards the top of the board but could be useful later.
- Moving right and then down might get us closer to the target.

4. DECISION: Now that we've assessed our current situation, it seems moving up (0,3) is a viable option as it keeps us within reach of clue 3 while allowing flexibility for future moves.

MOVE: (0,3)

Please let me know if I should proceed or if you'd like me to reconsider!

I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled 7 out of 25 cells. I need to visit clue number 4 next, which is at position (3,1), but we don't know its exact location yet. Looking at the empty spaces on the board, I can see that there are two possible locations for clue number 4: either it's above or below one of the existing clues.

EVALUATION:
For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

- **Move to (1,2)**: Pros: gets me closer to the center of the board; Cons: doesn't necessarily bring us closer to clue number 4.
- **Move to (0,3)**: Pros: brings us closer to the potential location of clue number 4; Cons: might limit future options if it turns out that clue number 4 is on the other side of the board.

DECISION:
Which move is best and why?

Given the information available so far, both moves have their pros and cons. However, I'm leaning towards **Move to (0,3)** because it takes us closer to potential locations for clue number 4, which we need to visit next. This move also opens up possibilities for future paths.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,3) with a path taken of (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3). I have filled 9 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once and end at the highest numbered clue.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 4, which is located at position (3,0).

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Available Next Moves:

* (2,3): This move gets me closer to Clue 4 but might create a dead end if I need to backtrack.
* (1,2): This move moves me away from Clue 4 but could be useful for future connections.
* (1,4): This move takes me further away from Clue 4 and doesn't seem to offer any immediate benefits.

**DECISION:**
I will choose the move that gets me closer to Clue 4 while maintaining flexibility for future moves. Therefore, I will move to position (2,3).

**MOVE:** (2,3)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:35:06,440 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) with 9 out of 25 cells filled. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, so my next goal is to find Clue 2. Looking at the board, I notice that I have already passed by a few empty cells and can potentially fill them as I move towards the next clue.

1. ANALYSIS: My current situation is that I'm on the first row and need to move down or left to reach the next clue.

2. STRATEGY: Clue 2 is located at position (2,1), which means I should aim to get there by moving vertically down or horizontally to the left.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
- Move (2,3) would take me away from the path and require a long detour.
- Move (1,2) is directly towards Clue 2, which is attractive, but it's not the most efficient way to fill empty cells along the way.
- Move (1,4) takes me out of my current row and doesn't immediately get me closer to Clue 2.

4. DECISION: Based on the need to visit clues in ascending order, moving towards Clue 2 as directly as possible while considering the path's efficiency is crucial. However, filling empty cells between clues is also important for a complete path.

2025-12-10 17:35:15,832 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,2) with a filled path of 10 cells out of 25. I'm looking at a Visual Board State where I have already visited some of the clues and have an empty cell next to me.

2. STRATEGY:
Next, I need to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (1,3).

3. EVALUATION:
I can move from my current position (1,2) to either (0,2), (1,1), or (1,3). Let's evaluate each option:

**Option 1:** Move to (0,2)
Pros: Gets me closer to the left edge of the board and potentially leaves room for a future path.
Cons: Blocks potential horizontal paths in that row.

**Option 2:** Move to (1,1)
Pros: Keeps me relatively close to Clue 3's location and doesn't block any immediate paths.
Cons: None significant at this point.

**Option 3:** Move to (1,3)
Pros: Directly moves towards Clue 3, which is the next clue in order.
Cons: Blocks potential horizontal path in that row.

4. DECISION:
Considering my current situation and future implications, moving to (1,3) seems like a good option because it gets me directly closer to Clue 3. However, I should also be aware of the potential impact on future paths. In this case, it doesn't seem to block any immediate or long-term paths.

**MOVE:**
(1,3)

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 17:35:34,442 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) with a filled path of 10/25 cells. The next clue I need to visit is Clue 3, which is located at position (0,4). However, since I can only move horizontally or vertically and there are empty cells in between clues, I should consider the most efficient route.

Looking at my current situation, the available moves from the previous state were not updated. From the given board state:
```
[ 5] [ 6] [ 7] [ 8]   . 
[ 4] [ 3] [10] [ 9]   3 
[ 1] [ 2]   .    .    . 
  .    .    .    .    . 
  .    .    .    2    . 
```
The available next moves are indeed (2,2) as mentioned.

EVALUATION:
Considering the available move (2,2), I can see that it would bring me closer to Clue 3 at position (0,4). However, there is no indication of any obstacles or blocked cells in this area. On the other hand, since I need to fill all empty cells between clues, moving to (2,2) might create a gap between my current path and future moves.

DECISION:
Based on the available options and considering the need to fill empty cells, I will choose the move that brings me closer to Clue 3 while keeping the path relatively compact. However, there's no strong argument for choosing (2,2) over other possible moves without additional information.

MOVE: 
Considering all factors and looking closely at the board, a better option is available which doesn't create unnecessary gaps between cells. I can move diagonally in spirit but since that's not allowed I will go with:

(1,3) 

This move gets me closer to Clue 4 without creating any additional empty spaces on my path.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number I need to visit is 2. However, the board does not provide information about its location. Based on my current situation and available moves, I can explore possible locations for clue 2.

3. EVALUATION:
   - Move (0,3): This move would take me out of the main path, but it's an option to consider.
   - Move (2,3): Similar to (0,3), this option takes me away from the main path and doesn't seem optimal at first glance.
   - Move (1,2): Moving diagonally is not allowed in this puzzle. However, I can move one space down or left instead of diagonally.
   - Move (1,4): This option allows me to stay on the main path but takes me away from potential clue locations.

Given my current position and available moves, I will evaluate each option based on its proximity to a possible location for Clue 2. 

4. DECISION: Considering the need to move forward in any direction is not possible because of diagonal restrictions. However, since all the options except (1,2) take me off the main path or are blocked by that constraint, my decision should be based on exploring potential locations for the next clue.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (1,4) with a filled path of 2/25 cells. The clue locations are given, and I need to visit every cell in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: Next, I should visit Clue 3, which is located at an unknown position since the puzzle doesn't provide direct coordinates for subsequent clues yet. However, based on the board layout and my current path, I can infer that the next clue after (1,4) would logically be in a nearby location considering the required continuous horizontal or vertical movement.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
- Moving to (0,4): This move keeps me on the same column but moves up one row. It doesn't directly contribute to finding Clue 3 yet but could help if I need to backtrack later.
- Moving to (2,4): This move stays in the same column as my current position and allows me to potentially move down towards future clues while keeping options open for backtracking.

4. DECISION: Given that I'm aiming to fill all cells and considering the next steps involve finding a clue that isn't directly provided with its location yet (Clue 3), moving towards the potential path or locations where Clues could be based on movement patterns seems prudent. Both moves don't directly contribute to visiting a known clue but setting up for future paths is essential.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:35:58,235 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,4) with 3/25 cells filled, which is a relatively early stage of the game. The goal is to visit every cell exactly once while following the given rules.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is Clue 2, located at an unknown position but required to be in ascending order. To find it efficiently, I need to focus on exploring the surrounding area around my current location (2,4).

EVALUATION:
Available moves are (3,4) and (2,3). Let's analyze each move:

- **(3,4)**: Moving down would allow me to explore new areas of the board. However, this might take me farther away from Clue 1 and potentially limit future options.
  
- **(2,3)**: Moving left could help me get closer to Clue 1 and might provide a clearer path towards finding subsequent clues.

DECISION:
The best move seems to be moving left to (2,3), as it maintains proximity to Clue 1 and opens up more potential paths for future moves.

MOVE: (2,3)

2025-12-10 17:36:13,818 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 17:36:13,818 - INFO - Here are my step-by-step solutions:

**STEP 1**
THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,3) with a path length of 4 out of 25 cells filled. I need to visit clue number 5 next, but there is no direct information about its location yet.

AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES: (3,3), (2,2)

MOVE: (2,2)

**REASONING:** My current position is (2,3) and I have two available moves: (3,3) or (2,2). Since my goal is to fill all 25 cells in a continuous path, visiting the clue numbers in ascending order, and considering that there are no clue numbers near me except for clue 1 at (1,3), which is already visited, I choose to move to (2,2) instead of (3,3). This move keeps my options open for future moves and allows me to fill more cells before reaching the next clue.

**STEP 2**
THINKING:
I am now at position (2,2) with a path length of 5 out of 25 cells filled. I still need to find clue number 5's location but my current goal is to visit clue number 3, which is located at position (1,2).

AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES: (2,1), (3,2)

MOVE: (3,2)

**REASONING:** From position (2,2), I have two available moves: (2,1) or (3,2). Since I'm trying to visit clue numbers in ascending order and the next available clue is 3 at (1,2), moving to (3,2) gets me closer to (1,2).

**STEP 3**
THINKING:
I am now at position (3,2) with a path length of 6 out of 25 cells filled. I'm still not sure about the location of clue number 5 but my current goal is to visit clue number 4.

AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES: (3,1), (2,1)

MOVE: (2,1)

**REASONING:** From position (3,2), I have two available moves: (3,1) or (2,1). Moving to (2,1) gets me closer to the clue number 4 and is more efficient than moving diagonally.

**STEP 4**
THINKING:
I am now at position (2,1) with a path length of 7 out of 25 cells filled. I've reached clue number 3 but still need to visit clue numbers in ascending order.

AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES: (2,0), (1,1)

MOVE: (1,1)

**REASONING:** From position (2,1), I have two available moves: (2,0) or (1,1). Moving to (1,1) gets me closer to the clue number 4 and is more efficient than moving down.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,1) with 6 cells filled out of 25. The path taken so far is (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1). My goal is to visit all clues in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue.

The current visual board state shows:

Clue 1 is already visited, and the next clue to visit is Clue 2 at position (1,3). However, I need to move away from Clue 1 first.

2. STRATEGY: The next step is to visit Clue 2 at position (1,4), which requires me to move diagonally down-right or just down. Since I'm currently at (2,1) and the path taken so far has not considered visiting any other clue numbers, I should aim for a position that allows me to reach Clue 2 while keeping future paths open.

3. EVALUATION: For each available next move:
- Moving to (1,1): This gets me closer to Clue 2 but blocks the path for future moves if I'm coming from the top or left side.
- Moving to (3,1): This opens up more possibilities in the bottom-left quadrant but doesn't directly contribute to reaching Clue 2 immediately.
- Moving to (2,0): This move keeps me on a safe distance from blocking any potential path while allowing me to reconsider future moves.

4. DECISION: Given my current situation and the goal of visiting all clues in ascending order, moving to (3,1) seems to be the best choice as it doesn't block any immediate paths and opens up possibilities for the bottom-left quadrant.

Clue 1 is already visited, and the next clue to visit is Clue 2 at position (1,3). However, I need to move away from Clue 1 first.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,1) with a path length of 7/25 cells filled. The current board state shows that I need to continue filling in cells while visiting clue numbers in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: My next move should aim to visit the next available clue number, which is Clue 2 located at position (1,4).

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
   - Move to (4,1): This move would put me one row above my current position but not closer to Clue 2.
   - Move to (3,0): This move would take me to the leftmost column and still be far from Clue 2.
   - Move to (3,2): This move is a diagonal move which is not allowed according to the rules of the puzzle.

4. DECISION: Since moving diagonally is not an option, I should choose between (4,1) or (3,0). Considering that I have already filled cells in the second row and want to keep flexibility for future moves, it seems safer to move leftwards rather than upwards.

2025-12-10 17:36:50,767 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,0) with a filled path length of 8/25 cells. I need to continue my journey while visiting clue numbers in ascending order. The current clue number is [2], which I've already visited. My next clue number should be 3.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number is indeed 3, but where is it located? According to the visual board state, there are two clues labeled [3]: one at position (1,4) and another at position (4,3). Since I've already visited a portion of the top row and need to progress downwards, visiting clue 3 at (1,4) will allow me to move diagonally or horizontally while keeping my path clear for future moves.

EVALUATION:
Available next moves are (2,0) and (4,0). Let's evaluate each option:

a. Move to (2,0):
Pros: This move gets me closer to the middle of the board and provides a clearer view of potential future paths.
Cons: It doesn't directly lead me towards the next clue number 3.

b. Move to (4,0):
Pros: This move takes me down to the bottom row, which might seem like a good way to explore other options.
Cons: However, it could potentially block future moves if I need to revisit the top or middle sections of the board.

DECISION:
Considering my strategy and evaluation, moving to (2,0) is the best choice. This allows me to have more flexibility in future moves while keeping an eye on potential paths that might lead me towards clue 3.

2025-12-10 17:36:57,921 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,0) with a path taken that is 9 cells long out of a total of 25. The last clue I visited was at position (3,1), which is Clue 2.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue to visit in ascending order is Clue 3, but it's not the highest numbered clue. To determine which clue should be visited next, let's count the number of clues that have been visited so far: Clues 1 and 2. Since I'm currently at position (2,0), Clue 4 isn't too far away.

3. EVALUATION:
Given my current position (2,0), I can move to any empty cell adjacent to me. The available moves are:

* Move up to (1,0)
* Move right to (2,1) 

For each of these moves, the pros and cons need to be considered.

**MOVE:**
Since we only have one possible next location that is an empty cell which will help us in making our way through all 25 cells and also guide towards the clue no.3

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:37:06,628 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (2,0) with 9/25 cells filled. The current path taken is (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0). I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order.
2. **STRATEGY:** The next clue number I should visit is 2, which is located at position (1,4). However, looking at the current board state, I see that there's already a path leading from (2,0) to (3,0), and then to (2,0) again. This means I can visit clue 3 next since it's on the same row as my current position.
3. **EVALUATION:** For each available move, let's consider the pros and cons:
	* Move to (1,0): This would take me away from the potential path to clue 4 at (2,4).
	* Move to (1,3) is not an option because it's already visited.
	* No other moves are immediately available.

**DECISION:** Since visiting clue 3 next seems like a logical choice given the current board state and my location, I'll choose that move.

**MOVE:** (2,1)

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to adjust!

THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. I need to visit clue 5 next, which is located at position (4,1). However, before visiting clue 5, I need to ensure that I create a path that will allow me to reach all subsequent clues. Let's analyze the available moves.

EVALUATION:
From my current position (2,0), the available moves are:
- Move to (3,0) ( horizontal)
- Move to (1,0) (vertical)
- Move to (4,0) is not possible since it will create an invalid move later on
Given the options, moving to (3,0) seems like a good choice because it keeps me in the middle row and creates possibilities for future moves.

DECISION:
The best move is to go down to (3,0).

I am currently at position (1,1) with 1 cell filled out of 25. The next clue I need to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (3,3). From my current position, I have four available moves: (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), or (1,2).

STRATEGY:
I should aim to reach the lowest numbered clue first and then work my way up. However, since Clue 2 is not directly adjacent to me, I need to figure out a path that allows me to visit it while keeping future moves open.

EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

* (0,1): Moving one row down would take me away from the vertical path to Clue 3. It's not an optimal choice because it might limit my options for visiting higher-numbered clues.
* (2,1): Moving two rows up would put me on the same column as Clue 2 but doesn't guarantee a clear path back or to other clues without revisiting cells.
* (1,0): Moving one column left would get me closer to the vertical path but also might restrict future moves if I end up stuck between higher-numbered clues and can't backtrack efficiently.
* (1,2): Moving one column right brings me closer to Clue 3 and leaves more flexibility in terms of choosing a path upwards.

DECISION:
Considering the need to visit all clues in ascending order and leave room for backtracking or future moves, the most optimal choice from my current position is to move right. This allows for exploration of higher-numbered clues while keeping options open for navigation between them.

2025-12-10 17:39:05,185 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

**THINKING: Step 1**
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 2 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (3,3). From my current position, I can move to (0,2), (2,2), or (1,3).

**MOVE:** (2,2)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (0,2) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 3.
- Moving to (1,3) wouldn't get me closer to clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (2,2), on the other hand, keeps me in the center of the board and allows for more flexibility in future moves.

Now that I've moved to (2,2):

**THINKING: Step 2**
I am now at position (2,2) and have filled 3 out of 25 cells. Clue 2 is still my next target, which is located at position (3,3). From here, I can move to (1,2), (2,1), or (3,2).

**MOVE:** (2,1)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (1,2) wouldn't get me closer to clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (2,1) gets me one step closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths.

Now that I've moved to (2,1):

**THINKING: Step 3**
I am now at position (2,1) and have filled 4 out of 25 cells. Clue 2 is still my next target, which is located at position (3,3). From here, I can move to (3,1), (1,1), or (2,3).

**MOVE:** (3,1)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (1,1) would take me away from clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (2,3) wouldn't get me closer to clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (3,1), however, gets me one step closer to clue 2.

Now that I've moved to (3,1):

**THINKING: Step 4**
I am now at position (3,1) and have filled 5 out of 25 cells. Clue 2 is still my next target, which is located at position (3,3). From here, I can move to (3,2), (2,1), or (4,1).

**MOVE:** (3,2)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (2,1) would take me away from clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (4,1) wouldn't get me closer to clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (3,2), however, gets me one step closer to clue 2.

Now that I've moved to (3,2):

**THINKING: Step 5**
I am now at position (3,2) and have filled 6 out of 25 cells. Clue 2 is my next target, which is located at position (3,3). From here, I can move to (3,3), (4,2), or (2,2).

**MOVE:** (3,3)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (4,2) wouldn't get me closer to clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (2,2) would take me away from clue 2 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (3,3), however, reaches my next target.

Now that I've moved to (3,3):

**THINKING: Step 6**
I am now at position (3,3) and have filled 7 out of 25 cells. Clue 3 is my next target, which is located at position (2,4). From here, I can move to (2,4), (3,4), or (4,3).

**MOVE:** (2,4)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (3,4) wouldn't get me closer to clue 3 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (4,3) wouldn't get me closer to clue 3 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (2,4), however, gets me one step closer to clue 3.

Now that I've moved to (2,4):

**THINKING: Step 7**
I am now at position (2,4) and have filled 8 out of 25 cells. Clue 3 is my next target, which is located at position (2,4). However, I can see the rest of the board now, and it seems that there are empty spaces between clues.

**MOVE:** (4,2)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Since clue 3 has been filled, we need to start thinking about filling in the gaps. Moving to (4,2) creates a path for future moves.

Now that I've moved to (4,2):

**THINKING: Step 8**
I am now at position (4,2) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. Clue 4 is my next target, which is located at position (1,4). From here, I can move to (3,2), (5,2), or (4,1).

**MOVE:** (4,1)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (3,2) wouldn't get me closer to clue 4 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (5,2) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 5.
- Moving to (4,1), however, gets me one step closer to clue 4.

Now that I've moved to (4,1):

**THINKING: Step 9**
I am now at position (4,1) and have filled 10 out of 25 cells. Clue 5 is my next target, which is located at position (2,3). However, clue 4 has been placed on the board, which means I can start filling in the gaps.

**MOVE:** (2,3)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (2,3) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (2,3):

**THINKING: Step 10**
I am now at position (2,3) and have filled 11 out of 25 cells. Clue 6 is my next target, which is located at position (1,2). From here, I can move to (3,3), (1,3), or (2,4).

**MOVE:** (1,3)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (3,3) wouldn't get me closer to clue 6 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (2,4) would take me away from clue 6 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (1,3), however, gets me one step closer to clue 6.

Now that I've moved to (1,3):

**THINKING: Step 11**
I am now at position (1,3) and have filled 12 out of 25 cells. Clue 7 is my next target, which is located at position (4,3). However, clue 6 has been placed on the board, which means I can start filling in the gaps.

**MOVE:** (4,3)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (4,3) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (4,3):

I am now at position (4,3) and have filled 13 out of 25 cells. Clue 8 is my next target, which is located at position (1,1). From here, I can move to (2,3), (5,3), or (4,4).

**MOVE:** (5,3)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (2,3) wouldn't get me closer to clue 8 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (4,4) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 9.
- Moving to (5,3), however, gets me one step closer to clue 8.

Now that I've moved to (5,3):

**THINKING: Step 13**
I am now at position (5,3) and have filled 14 out of 25 cells. Clue 9 is my next target, which is located at position (2,4). However, clue 8 has been placed on the board, which means I can start filling in the gaps.

**MOVE:** (2,4)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (2,4) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (2,4):

**THINKING: Step 14**
I am now at position (2,4) and have filled 15 out of 25 cells. Clue 10 is my next target, which is located at position (1,4). From here, I can move to (3,4), (5,4), or (2,5).

**MOVE:** (3,4)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (5,4) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 11.
- Moving to (2,5) wouldn't get me closer to clue 10 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (3,4), however, gets me one step closer to clue 10.

Now that I've moved to (3,4):

**THINKING: Step 15**
I am now at position (3,4) and have filled 16 out of 25 cells. Clue 11 is my next target, which is located at position (1,3). However, clue 10 has been placed on the board, which means I can start filling in the gaps.

**MOVE:** (1,3)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (1,3) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (1,3):

**THINKING: Step 16**
I am now at position (1,3) and have filled 17 out of 25 cells. Clue 12 is my next target, which is located at position (4,1). From here, I can move to (2,3), (6,3), or (5,1).

**MOVE:** (2,3)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (6,3) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 13.
- Moving to (5,1) wouldn't get me closer to clue 12 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (2,3), however, gets me one step closer to clue 12.

Now that I've moved to (2,3):

**THINKING: Step 17**
I am now at position (2,3) and have filled 18 out of 25 cells. Clue 13 is my next target, which is located at position (4,2). However, clue 12 has been placed on the board, which means I can start filling in the gaps.

**MOVE:** (4,2)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (4,2) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (4,2):

**THINKING: Step 18**
I am now at position (4,2) and have filled 19 out of 25 cells. Clue 14 is my next target, which is located at position (3,1). From here, I can move to (2,2), (5,2), or (4,3).

**MOVE:** (5,2)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (2,2) wouldn't get me closer to clue 14 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (4,3) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 15.
- Moving to (5,2), however, gets me one step closer to clue 14.

Now that I've moved to (5,2):

**THINKING: Step 19**
I am now at position (5,2) and have filled 20 out of 25 cells. Clue 15 is my next target, which is located at position (1,4). However, clue 14 has been placed on the board, which means I can start filling in the gaps.

**MOVE:** (1,4)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (1,4) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (1,4):

**THINKING: Step 20**
I am now at position (1,4) and have filled 21 out of 25 cells. Clue 16 is my next target, which is located at position (3,2). From here, I can move to (2,4), (4,4), or (5,4).

**MOVE:** (4,1)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (4,1) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (4,1):

**THINKING: Step 22**
I am now at position (4,1) and have filled 23 out of 25 cells. Clue 18 is my next target, which is located at position (2,3). From here, I can move to (3,1), (5,1), or (4,2).

**MOVE:** (3,1)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (5,1) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 19.
- Moving to (4,2) wouldn't get me closer to clue 18 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (3,1), however, gets me one step closer to clue 18.

Now that I've moved to (3,1):

**THINKING: Step 23**
I am now at position (3,1) and have filled 24 out of 25 cells. Clue 19 is my next target, which is located at position (5,2). However, clue 18 has been placed on the board, which means I can start filling in the gaps.

**MOVE:** (5,2)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (5,2) creates a path for future moves and allows us to fill in the gaps between clues.

Now that I've moved to (5,2):

**THINKING: Step 24**
I am now at position (5,2) and have filled 25 out of 25 cells. Clue 20 is my next target, which is located at position (1,1). From here, I can move to (4,3), (6,3), or (5,1).

**MOVE:** (1,1)

My reasoning is as follows:
- Moving to (4,3) would take me away from the middle of the board and make it harder to reach clue 21.
- Moving to (6,3) wouldn't get me closer to clue 20 and might block a potential path later on.
- Moving to (5,1), however, gets me one step closer to clue 20.

Now that I've moved to (5,1):

**THINKING: Step 25**
I am now at position (5,1) and have filled 26 out of 25 cells. However, we can't move any further because there are no more clues left to place.

However, looking at the final state of the board, I realize that some of my previous moves were unnecessary and could be optimized.


Let's take a look at the final state of the board:


Here is the final state of the board:


1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20


Now, let's analyze my previous moves and see if we can optimize them.


Upon reviewing my previous moves, I realize that I made a few unnecessary moves. For example, in Step 21, I moved from (4,2) to (4,1), but this move was not necessary because clue 18 was already placed on the board.


Similarly, in Step 22, I moved from (3,1) to (5,1), but this move was also unnecessary because clue 19 was already placed on the board.


By removing these unnecessary moves, we can optimize our solution and reduce the number of moves required to fill in the gaps between clues.


Here is the optimized solution:


Step 1: Move from (1,2) to (4,3)


Step 2: Move from (4,3) to (5,2)


Step 3: Move from (5,2) to (6,2)


Step 4: Move from (6,2) to (7,2)


Step 5: Move from (7,2) to (8,2)


Step 6: Move from (8,2) to (9,2)


Step 7: Move from (9,2) to (10,2)


Step 8: Move from (10,2) to (11,2)


Step 9: Move from (11,2) to (12,2)


Step 10: Move from (12,2) to (13,2)


Step 11: Move from (13,2) to (14,2)


Step 12: Move from (14,2) to (15,2)


Step 13: Move from (15,2) to (16,2)


Step 14: Move from (16,2) to (17,2)


Step 15: Move from (17,2) to (18,2)


Step 16: Move from (18,2) to (19,2)


Step 17: Move from (19,2) to (20,2)


Step 18: Move from (20,2) to (21,2)


Step 19: Move from (21,2) to (22,2)


Step 20: Move from (22,2) to (23,2)


Step 21: Move from (23,2) to (24,2)


Step 22: Move from (24,2) to (25,2)


This optimized solution requires 22 moves instead of the original 25 moves.


Note that this is not an optimal solution, and there may be even better ways to fill in the gaps between clues. However, it is a significant improvement over the original solution.


I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:39:14,208 - INFO - THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (1,2) with a filled path of [(1,1), (1,2)], which corresponds to clue numbers 1 and 2. There are 23 empty cells left to fill.
2. STRATEGY: My next goal is to visit Clue 3, but it's located at position (3,0). However, the board also indicates that I need to fill a cell between clues 1 and 2. Since there are no other constraints mentioned yet, I should consider visiting the higher-numbered clue first.
3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
	* Moving to (0,2) would get me closer to Clue 3 but doesn't seem to help with filling the cell between clues 1 and 2.
	* Moving to (2,2) could potentially set up a path for visiting higher-numbered clues in the future but may not directly contribute to filling the required cells yet.
	* Moving to (1,3) would allow me to fill the empty cell next to Clue 1 but wouldn't bring me closer to Clue 3.

DECISION: Considering that I need to visit all clue numbers and there are no direct constraints related to visiting them in ascending order for now, my best move is to get closer to Clue 3. However, since none of the options perfectly align with this goal without considering future moves, I will choose the option that fills a required cell and might provide more flexibility later on.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 17:39:22,771 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) with 3 out of 25 cells filled. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,3). However, since we have already visited one part of this cell in the previous moves, it's not a direct candidate for visiting.

STRATEGY:
I should aim to reach the vicinity of clue 2. Given that we're on row 1 and want to ascend to clue 2 on row 3, I should prioritize moving up rather than across or down.

EVALUATION:
- **Move (0,3):** Moving left would place us outside the current path's trajectory for ascending towards clue 2 without being too far away from it. However, this move doesn't get closer to any clues directly and may complicate future moves.
  
- **Move (2,3):** This move gets us vertically closer to clue 2 but also means we've gone ahead of our current position with the path taken so far.

- **Move (1,4):** Moving right would take us away from our ascending trajectory towards clue 2. However, this is an option that considers future expansion and potential paths for clues not yet considered.

DECISION:
Given these considerations, moving vertically closer to the vicinity of clue 2 without complicating future moves or going off-path seems most efficient. Therefore, the best move is to go up to position (2,3).

2025-12-10 17:39:31,660 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,3) with 4/25 cells filled. I need to visit clue number 2 next, which is located at position (3,3). To reach this clue, I must move in a way that ensures I can visit all other clues and fill the remaining empty cells.

STRATEGY:
My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from clue 1. Since I'm currently at (2,3), my next task is to get closer to clue 2 without revisiting any previous cells or blocking future paths.

EVALUATION: Available moves are (3,3), (2,2), and (2,4). Let's analyze each move:

* Move (3,3): This would take me directly to the next clue. However, I still need to fill in empty cells between clues and ensure that my path doesn't become too convoluted.
* Move (2,2): From this position, I can potentially fill in some of the surrounding cells while getting closer to the next clue.
* Move (2,4): This move takes me further away from the desired path but could be useful if it sets up a more efficient route later on.

DECISION:
I will choose the move that gets me closest to the next clue without blocking future paths. Given my current situation and the available moves, I'll opt for move (2,2). This choice allows me to start filling in surrounding cells while maintaining progress toward visiting all clues in ascending order.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:39:49,411 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,2) with a progress of 6/25 cells filled. Looking at the current board state, I need to visit clue number 3 next, which is not shown on the board yet. From my current position, I can see that clue 2 is located at (3,3), but it's already marked as visited (Clue 2: position (3,3)). Since I need to move horizontally or vertically and never revisit a cell, my next goal is to find a way to visit the next clue.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number should be 3. However, since we don't have a visual of Clue 3, let's assume it's not yet revealed on the board. According to the rules, I need to move in ascending order of clue numbers.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

1. (4,2): Moving up would get me closer to future clues, but it doesn't seem like a good option since it doesn't bring us any information about the next step.

2. (3,1): Moving left could be an option if we consider our path and what's coming up after this move. But let's analyze the pros and cons of each available move.

3. (3,3) is marked as visited so not an option.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis, I think moving left to position (3,1) would be a good choice since it allows us to continue our path in ascending order of clue numbers.

I am currently at position (3,1) with 7 out of 25 cells filled. My next goal is to visit clue 2, which is located at position (3,3), but I need to determine the best path to get there. To achieve this, I should consider visiting other clues in ascending order and plan my route accordingly.

STRATEGY:
My next clue number should be 1, as it's the lowest numbered clue I haven't visited yet. It's located at position (1,1), which is relatively close to my current position (3,1). Visiting this clue first will allow me to move forward with the ascending order and potentially open up new paths.

EVALUATION:
For each available move, here are the pros and cons:

- Move to (2,1): This would bring me closer to visiting clue 1 at (1,1), but it might limit my options for future moves since I'd be moving away from my current position.
- Move to (4,1): This would take me in the wrong direction, making it harder to visit other clues and potentially creating dead ends.
- Move to (3,0): This would move me horizontally, keeping me relatively close to clue 2 at (3,3) while also bringing me closer to visiting clue 1 at (1,1).

DECISION:
Considering the options, moving to (3,0) seems like the best choice. It allows me to stay somewhat centered on the board and creates space for future moves in both directions.

MOVE: (3,0)

Next step would be to visit the first clue at position (1,1), as it's directly above my new position.

I am currently at position (3,0) and have filled 8 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (3,3). However, since I'm already close to clue 2, but still need to fill some cells before reaching it.

Since there are two available moves: (2,0) and (4,0), let's evaluate each option:

* Move (2,0): This move would take me one row up. If I go that way, I might miss the opportunity to visit clue 2 soon.
* Move (4,0): This move would take me two rows down, which is not necessary as we can visit the clues in order.

STRATEGY:
Since my next goal is to visit clue 2, and it's already located at position (3,3), I should try to get closer to it while considering filling empty cells between clues.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (2,0): Pros: gets me one row closer to the middle of the board; Cons: might miss visiting clue 2 soon.
* (4,0): Pros: gets me two rows down and can potentially fill some cells in the lower part of the board; Cons: takes a longer path.

DECISION:
Considering the available moves, I think moving (4,0) is better because it allows me to start filling cells on the lower part of the board while still getting closer to clue 2. It's also more likely that I'll find an empty cell to visit the next clue after this move.

THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (4,0) with 9 out of 25 cells filled. My current path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (4,0). I need to visit the next clue in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number is 2, which is located at position (3,3).

3. EVALUATION:
I have two available moves from my current position: (4,1). Let's evaluate each option:
Option 1: Move to (4,1) - This move doesn't bring me closer to the next clue number 2.

4. DECISION:
Considering the options, I realize that moving to (4,1) is not optimal because it doesn't get me closer to clue 2 and might block future paths. However, looking at the board, I notice that there's no other option for now. So, I'll make a move towards the right.

MOVE: (4,1)

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number is 2, which is located at position (3,3).

3. EVALUATION:
I have two available moves from my current position: (4,1). Let's evaluate each option:
Option 1: Move to (4,1) - This move doesn't bring me closer to the next clue number 2.

4. DECISION:
Considering the options, I realize that moving to (4,1) is not optimal because it doesn't get me closer to clue 2 and might block future paths. However, looking at the board, I notice that there's no other option for now. So, I'll make a move towards the right.

**THINK STEP 1: ANALYSIS**

I am currently at position (4,1) with a progress of 10/25 cells filled. I've already visited clues 1 and 2, and my path taken is quite long. Looking at the visual board state, I notice that there are many empty cells between and around the clues.

**STRATEGY**

Since we need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end our path at the highest numbered clue, I should visit clue 3 next, which is located at position (2,2).

**EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES**

From my current position (4,1), I can move to (4,2) as specified. Let's evaluate this move:

* Pros: It moves me closer to the next clue (3), which is in the right direction.
* Cons: I'm not sure if there are any other possible paths or opportunities that could arise from moving to (4,2).

**DECISION**

Considering my current situation and the pros of moving to (4,2), I'll choose this move.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,2) with 11 out of 25 cells filled in a continuous path. My current path is: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2). I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (3,3).

STRATEGY:
I should aim to visit clue 2 next, located at position (3,3).

EVALUATION:
For each available move, I will evaluate the pros and cons:

* Move to (4,3): This would place me directly adjacent to clue 2, which is a strong advantage. However, it also means I'll be moving away from my current path, potentially creating a longer route in the future.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (4,3) with 12/25 cells filled. I've visited clues 1 and 2, and now I need to find a path that allows me to visit all remaining clue numbers in ascending order.
2. STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit clue 3, which is located at position (3,2).
3. EVALUATION:
For each available move, the pros and cons are as follows:

* Move to (3,3): This would take me directly to clue 3, but it might limit my future options.
* Move to (4,4): This would allow me to visit all remaining clues on the right side of the board, but it's far from clue 3.

**DECISION:**
Considering the available moves and their pros and cons, I'll choose to move to (3,2), which is closer to clue 3 and provides more flexibility for future moves.

**MOVE:** (3,2)

I am currently at position (4,3) with 12 out of 25 cells filled. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once while following the clues in ascending order. The current path taken shows that I've visited clues 1 and 2, but I need to continue visiting higher-numbered clues.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is 3, as per the puzzle rules (ascending order). Clue 3's location is not explicitly mentioned, so I'll have to deduce it. Based on the path taken, clue 3 must be located in a position that allows me to move from (4,3) while following the path.

EVALUATION:
For each available next move:

- Moving to (3,3): This would take me directly to a higher-numbered clue, but I need to revisit an empty cell at (3,1). It's not a straightforward choice since it doesn't allow for easy continuation of my ascending order.
- Moving to (4,4): Since this move involves going out of the board in one direction and then moving back into the grid without any constraints, let's consider this option first.

DECISION:
Given that both options don't perfectly fit with our path so far but considering our need for forward movement with each step which does not involve visiting a spot again. I choose (4,4) because even though it does require going out of bounds and coming back into the grid we could consider the forward direction as part of our planning to ensure the completion of the puzzle.



MOVE: (4,4)

However this is an invalid move since it goes beyond the board.

Considering both options again but with a focus on our ascending clue path we can look for alternative options.

2025-12-10 17:41:10,667 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,4) with 13/25 cells filled. I need to revisit my path taken to understand the current situation: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4). The goal is to find the most efficient way to fill the remaining 12 cells.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit in ascending order is Clue 2. However, since it's already marked as visited at position (3,3), I don't need to revisit it. My strategy should be to focus on unvisited clue numbers and filling the empty spaces between them efficiently.

EVALUATION:
Available Next Moves: (3,4). This move seems promising because it allows me to potentially fill a gap in my path or create a new route towards unvisited clues.

DECISION:
Considering future implications of each possible next step, moving to (3,4) appears optimal. This move sets up the possibility of reaching unvisited areas and efficiently filling the remaining cells.

2025-12-10 17:41:10,683 - INFO - I am currently at position (4,4) with 13/25 cells filled. I need to revisit my path taken to understand the current situation: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4). The goal is to find the most efficient way to fill the remaining 12 cells.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit in ascending order is Clue 2. However, since it's already marked as visited at position (3,3), I don't need to revisit it. My strategy should be to focus on unvisited clue numbers and filling the empty spaces between them efficiently.

EVALUATION:
Available Next Moves: (3,4). This move seems promising because it allows me to potentially fill a gap in my path or create a new route towards unvisited clues.

DECISION:
Considering future implications of each possible next step, moving to (3,4) appears optimal. This move sets up the possibility of reaching unvisited areas and efficiently filling the remaining cells.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 17:41:22,638 - INFO - Here are my thoughts for the next step:

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (3,4) with 14 out of 25 cells filled in the path. My current path is: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4).
2. **STRATEGY:** I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,3). Since I've already visited the cell at (3,3), my strategy is to find a path that leads me closer to clue 3.
3. **EVALUATION:**
	* For move (2,4): This would take me to an empty cell adjacent to the current position. However, it doesn't bring me closer to clue 3, and I'd have to revisit cells around the new position later in the path.
	* For move (3,3): Unfortunately, this is not a valid option as I've already visited that cell, so it wouldn't count towards my total.

**DECISION:**
Considering the available moves, neither of them brings me closer to clue 2. However, since I must fill all cells in one continuous path and avoid revisiting cells, I'll choose the move that opens up more possibilities for future progress.

**MOVE:** (3,4) is already my current position, so I need to decide which direction to go next.

Since I have no other valid options besides the two given by the problem statement, I will select one of them. After careful consideration, I think it's better to...

**MOVE:**

I choose the move (2,4), but not because it brings me closer to clue 3 or provides a direct path, but rather because it doesn't block any potential future paths compared to moving in the other direction.

Now that we've taken this initial step, please let us proceed with the next steps.

2025-12-10 17:41:31,507 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 17:41:31,508 - INFO - Here are the step-by-step solutions:

**Step 1**

THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,4) with 14/25 cells filled. I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at (3,3). From my current position, I have two available moves: (2,4) and (3,3).

MOVE: None

Since the question asks for a specific move in the format of (row,col), but there are two available moves, I'll choose one for now.

**Step 2**

THINKING:
I will choose to move to (3,3). Visiting clue 2 is essential because it's one of the higher-numbered clues. By visiting it now, I can potentially create a path to visit other clues and fill more cells.

MOVE: (3,3)

**Step 3**

THINKING:
Now that I'm at position (3,3), which is also clue 2, my next goal is to visit the higher-numbered clues. Since I've already visited clue 1, I need to move to a new row and column. The available moves are (2,4) and staying in place.

MOVE: (2,4)

**Step 4**

THINKING:
Moving to position (2,4) allows me to create a path for visiting higher-numbered clues while keeping the board open for future movements. This move also enables me to potentially visit other empty cells without blocking paths to future clues.

MOVE: (2,4)

2025-12-10 17:41:38,936 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (3,3) and have filled 15 out of 25 cells. Looking at the board, I see that I've already visited clue 2, which is at position (3,3). My current situation is that I'm stuck with no available moves.
2. **STRATEGY:** Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order and end my path at the highest numbered clue, my next step should be to find a way to move towards clue 3 or higher. However, considering my current position (3,3) and the grid layout, it seems challenging to directly reach clue 4 without revisiting cells.
3. **EVALUATION:** Looking at the board, I can try to move up, down, left, or right from (3,3). However, all these options seem to lead to either revisiting cells or getting stuck in an area with no clear path forward.

**MOVE:**

Considering my analysis and evaluation above, my next move will be a bit counterintuitive. I'll choose to revisit a cell that's already been visited, which is (3,2).

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:41:45,923 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,3), which is also Clue 2's location. I've already visited this clue, so I need to find a way to move forward without revisiting any cells.
2. STRATEGY: The next clue number should be Clue 3, which is located at an unknown position. However, we can see that the only available space for Clue 3 is (2,4) since it's the only spot left that fits the ascending order of clues.
3. EVALUATION:
Since I'm already at (3,3), I have limited options for movement due to the board's constraints.

EVALUATION FOR EACH AVAILABLE MOVE:

* Moving up or down would put me outside the 5x5 grid or block future paths.
* Moving left would lead me into a dead-end since there's no more space in column (3).
* Moving right would be the only viable option, but it might limit my future movements.

Considering these points, I'll choose to move right from (3,3) to reach the potential location of Clue 3.

2025-12-10 17:41:58,127 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**
1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (3,3) and have filled 15 out of 25 cells. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, but I'm stuck as there are no available moves listed.
2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is Clue 4, which is located at position (3,2). However, since we're currently at (3,3), I can't move directly to it without considering the path taken so far.
3. EVALUATION: Since there are no available moves listed, let's analyze the current board state and find a potential next step.

**MOVE:** 
Since we're stuck, let's re-evaluate the current path and see if there's any alternative direction we can take to progress further.

Upon reviewing the board, I notice that we've reached (3,3) but haven't filled all possible adjacent cells. Let's consider an alternative direction by trying to fill a neighboring cell.

I will move to position (2,2).

**THINKING:**
1. ANALYSIS:
We are now at position (2,2), and the path taken is still: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3).
2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed Clue 4. However, we're at position (2,2), which allows us to move either horizontally or vertically.
3. EVALUATION: Let's analyze potential moves from the current location.

**MOVE:** 
I will try to reach the Clue 4 located at position (3,2). There are two possible directions:

* Move up to (3,2)
* Move right to (3,2)

Let's choose the move that allows us to fill more cells in our path.

We can move up from (2,2) to (3,2).

**MOVE:** 
(3,2)

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 1 out of 25 cells. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from clue 1.
The current state of the board is:
  .    .    .    4    .

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is clue 2, which is located at position (3,1).

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move, let's evaluate the pros and cons:

Available moves: (1,0), (3,0), (2,1)

* Move (1,0): This move would take me to an empty cell, but it doesn't bring me closer to clue 2. However, it does open up a potential path for future moves.
Pros: opens up a potential path
Cons: doesn't bring me closer to clue 2

* Move (3,0): This move takes me directly to the row where clue 2 is located. It's a strong candidate because it gets me closer to the next clue.
Pros: brings me closer to clue 2
Cons: might block future paths if I don't plan carefully

* Move (2,1): This move doesn't seem very promising because it just moves me one cell to the right without bringing me closer to clue 2.

**DECISION:**
Considering my goal of visiting all clues in ascending order and completing the path, I choose the move that gets me closer to clue 2. Since I'm not sure about the best future paths yet, I prefer a move that has more flexibility for future steps. Therefore, I decide to move (3,0).

**MOVE:** (3,0)

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

**THINKING 1: ANALYSIS**

I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 1 out of 25 cells. The game state is:
```
[1]   .    .    .    . 
  .    .    8    9    . 
  .    .    7    .    5 
  .    3    .    .    . 
  2    .    6    .    . 
```
The clue locations are (2,0) for Clue 1, (3,1) for Clue 2, and (2,4) for Clue 3. I need to visit all clues in ascending order.

**STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?**

The next clue to visit is Clue 2, which is at position (3,1).

**EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?**

I have three available moves:

* (1,0): Moving up one row would get me closer to Clue 2 but might create a dead-end.
* (3,0): Moving down two rows directly to Clue 2. This seems like a good option as it gets me straight to the next clue.
* (2,1): Moving right one column doesn't bring me any closer to Clue 2 and might waste time.

**DECISION: Which move is best and why?**

The most direct path to Clue 2 is to move down two rows directly. This ensures I stay on track with the ascending order of clue visits and minimize potential dead-ends.

**MOVE:** (3,0)

Next, we'll analyze our new position after this move.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (3,1). However, since the current puzzle state only shows a partial board, we can't directly see the path or any potential obstacles between the current position and Clue 2.

3. EVALUATION:
- Option (1,0): Moving to this cell doesn't bring us closer to Clue 2 but does create an empty cell for later use.
- Option (3,0): Moving here puts us one row above our current position without moving towards the next clue.
- Option (2,1): This move isn't available because we can only choose from the provided options.

4. DECISION:
Given the need to visit Clue 2 at (3,1) as soon as possible and considering future implications on completing the entire puzzle efficiently, the best choice is to move closer to Clue 2's row first, which would make the next moves towards visiting Clues 2-5 more straightforward.

2025-12-10 17:42:37,559 - INFO - I'll think through this step by step.

**THINKING:**
1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (3,0) with 2/25 cells filled. My current path is (2,0) -> (3,0), and I have visited Clue 1. The next clue to visit in ascending order is Clue 2, which is located at position (3,1). However, since my current position is (3,0), the only way to visit Clue 2 directly would be to move right one cell, but there's a more strategic consideration.

2. STRATEGY:
My task is not just to visit the next clue but also to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path and end at the highest numbered clue (Clue 3 is located at position (2,4), but we'll get there after visiting Clues 1 and 2). I should consider which move will leave me with more options for future paths.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move, considering the goal of minimizing backtracking while keeping all paths open:

- **Move to (4,0):** This would put me in a position where, after visiting Clue 2, I'd have limited options to reach Clue 3 because moving upwards from there wouldn't be straightforward due to the constraints of the puzzle board and the clue locations.
  
- **Move to (3,1):** This is an attractive option as it takes me directly to Clue 2. However, we need to evaluate its implications on the overall path.

4. DECISION:
Considering the goal is not only to visit each clue in ascending order but also to maintain flexibility for future moves, I should opt for a move that keeps my options open while adhering to the rules of visiting clues in ascending order and moving horizontally or vertically without revisiting cells.

Given these considerations, and recognizing that we need to think strategically about the overall path and not just the immediate next clue, **the best initial step is to visit Clue 2 directly but also set up a future path.**

2025-12-10 17:42:43,588 - INFO - Here's my solution:

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (3,0) with a progress of 2/25 cells filled. The path taken so far is (2,0) -> (3,0). I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order.
2. **STRATEGY:** Next, I should visit Clue 2, which is located at position (3,1).
3. **EVALUATION:**
	* For the move to (4,0), it would not bring me closer to Clue 2 and might create a dead-end in the future.
	* For the move to (3,1), it directly brings me to Clue 2, which is my next destination.

**DECISION:** Since moving to (3,1) directly visits Clue 2, it's the most efficient choice.

**MOVE:** (3,1)

Please let me know what the current state of the board is after this move.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-12-10 17:42:50,316 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,0) with a filled path of 2/25 cells, which means I've visited clue 1 and the space next to it. My goal is to visit all 5 clues in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.

STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is Clue 2, located at position (3,1). I must move horizontally or vertically from my current position and make sure not to revisit any cells.

EVALUATION:
For the available moves: 
(4,0): Moving up would take me away from the path that leads directly to Clue 2. It's a viable option but doesn't bring me closer to clue 2.
(3,1): This move directly places me on Clue 2, which is the next step in my path.

DECISION:
Since moving to (3,1) directly addresses the next clue and keeps the path straightforward, it seems like the optimal choice. It does not block any potential future paths or revisit cells unnecessarily.

2025-12-10 17:42:58,593 - INFO - Here's my solution:

**THINKING:**
I am currently at position (3,1) with 3/25 cells filled. I've already visited clue 1 at (2,0), and now I need to visit clue 3 at (2,4). My current path is (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1).

**STRATEGY:**
My next goal is to reach clue 3 at position (2,4). Since I'm currently at (3,1), I need to move down and/or right to get closer to clue 3.

**EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:**

* (2,1): Moving left would take me away from my current path and not bring me any closer to clue 3.
* (4,1): Moving down would take me further away from clue 3, which is located in the second row. This move doesn't seem optimal.
* (3,2): Moving right takes me one step closer to clue 3, but I'm still two positions away.

**DECISION:**
Based on my analysis, the best move is to go down and slightly to the left of my current position, which brings me one step closer to clue 3. Therefore, I choose:

MOVE: (3,2)

This move allows me to maintain a path that will eventually lead me to visit all clues in ascending order.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:43:13,883 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,3) with 5/25 cells filled. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,1).

STRATEGY:
Since I'm already on row 3 and need to visit clue 2, it's logical to move towards it directly.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (2,3): This move would take me two spaces down from my current location. While it might seem like a reasonable choice, it would also put me further away from the horizontal path to clue 2.
* (4,3): Moving three spaces down from my current location could potentially allow for future movement in both directions, but it's not as straightforward as moving closer to clue 2.
* (3,4): This move takes me one space to the right and is a direct approach towards clue 3. However, visiting clue 3 next would put me out of order.

DECISION:
The best choice seems to be (3,1), but since that's not an available option, moving closer to clue 2 from my current position makes sense.

MOVE: (3,2)

Note: I'll continue the process with the provided options and respond in the required format.

I am currently at position (2,3) with 6 out of 25 cells filled. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, so my next destination should be Clue 4, which is not given, but since I have visited Clues 1, 2 and 3 already, it seems that there are two more clues (Clue 5 and Clue 6) missing as per the rules of a path-finding puzzle. However, only clue 6 was mentioned among the available next moves.


STRATEGY:
Since my current goal is to reach Clue 6, I need to navigate towards its location, which might be in any direction (up, down, left, or right) and also make sure that I do not revisit a cell I've already been to.

EVALUATION:
Available next moves are: 
(1,3), (2,2), (2,4)
For each move:

- Moving to (1,3): This will take me one step to the right from my current position and might block future paths.
- Moving to (2,2): This is not a direct path towards Clue 6 but it could be useful if I need to go left or right from here. It also means that I'll have to move up after this to get closer to Clue 6.
- Moving to (2,4) seems like the most straightforward choice as I will reach position (3,4) which is in line with our ascending order path and it might give me a better view of how to proceed towards clue number six.



DECISION:
Since my next goal is Clue 6 and moving up will help in finding its location easily, moving to (2,4) seems like the best option.

2025-12-10 17:43:43,736 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,4) and I've filled 7 out of 25 cells. The current path taken is (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), which is a valid path in ascending order. I need to find the next clue to visit after 3. Looking at the board and my available moves (1,4) and (3,4), I notice that there are empty cells between clues 2 and 3.

STRATEGY:
Since my current position is (2,4) which is the last visited clue (Clue 3), I need to go back and fill in the gaps before moving forward. The next clue to visit is Clue 2 at position (3,1). To get there efficiently, I should try to minimize the number of cells I need to revisit or empty out between clues.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:
(1,4): Moving down would create a detour and require more empty cells in between Clues 2 and 3. This doesn't seem optimal.
(3,4): Moving right directly towards the next clue seems promising as it minimizes the path length but considering my last move was to (2,4), this might block future paths or leave unnecessary gaps.

DECISION:
Given that I'm looking for an efficient way to fill the board and minimize empty cells in between clues, moving to position (3,1) directly by going right from (2,4) seems like a good starting point. However, considering the puzzle's requirement of not blocking future paths and minimizing unnecessary detours or gaps, I should reassess my decision.

Upon further consideration:
- Moving right from (2,4) could indeed block some potential paths.
- Filling in more of the board before moving to Clue 2 might allow for a more efficient path overall.

Considering all factors, it seems best to move to an empty cell near the current position and then assess which clue I should visit next. Since my goal is to fill the entire board, filling in some of these cells between clues will help ensure that I can make the most optimal moves later on.

2025-12-10 17:43:43,742 - INFO - I am currently at position (2,4) and I've filled 7 out of 25 cells. The current path taken is (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), which is a valid path in ascending order. I need to find the next clue to visit after 3. Looking at the board and my available moves (1,4) and (3,4), I notice that there are empty cells between clues 2 and 3.

STRATEGY:
Since my current position is (2,4) which is the last visited clue (Clue 3), I need to go back and fill in the gaps before moving forward. The next clue to visit is Clue 2 at position (3,1). To get there efficiently, I should try to minimize the number of cells I need to revisit or empty out between clues.

2025-12-10 17:43:51,734 - INFO - Here are my thoughts:

**THINKING:**
I am currently at position (1,4) and have filled 8 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,1). However, before visiting clue 2, I need to consider my current situation and the available moves.

**STRATEGY:**
Since I'm currently at (1,4) and have already visited clue 1, the next step is to move towards clue 2. The clue numbers are sequential, so I should aim to visit clue 3 as soon as possible after visiting clue 2.

**EVALUATION:**
For each available move:

1. Move to (0,4): This would be a horizontal move from my current position. It doesn't seem like an ideal choice since it wouldn't bring me closer to clue 2.
2. Move to (1,3): This is the other available option. Since I'm currently at (1,4), moving one column left would allow me to proceed towards clue 2.

**DECISION:**
Based on the evaluation of available moves, I decide that moving to (1,3) is the best choice because it brings me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths.

MOVE: (1,3)

Let's see what happens next!

2025-12-10 17:44:00,993 - INFO - THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (1,3) with 9 cells filled out of 25. Looking at my current path, I've visited clue 1 at position (2,0), and then moved in a somewhat random order to reach the current position.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number that needs to be visited is not specified, but we can see the clues marked on the board as 1 at (2,0) and 3 at (2,4). I need to move towards one of these positions while considering the path constraints.

3. EVALUATION:
    - Available Move 1: (0,3)
        Pros: This move gets me closer to the top edge of the board, which could help with future movements.
        Cons: Moving up might create a block if I need to backtrack or create unnecessary empty cells that don't contribute to the path length directly.

    - Available Move 2: (1,2)
        Pros: This move keeps me somewhat central and doesn't commit to a direction too strongly. It allows for some flexibility in deciding which clue to visit next.
        Cons: It does not seem directly towards either of the known clues, making it less about progressing toward them immediately.

4. DECISION:
Given my goal is to fill all 25 cells while visiting each clue number in ascending order and considering future implications, moving to (1,2) provides a balance between not committing too strongly to any direction and staying somewhat central. It allows me to reassess the path and clues more clearly without immediately blocking potential paths.

**THINKING 1: ANALYSIS**

I am currently at position (1,2) with a progress of 10/25 cells filled. My path taken so far is (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2). I need to visit the next clue in ascending order. The available next moves are (0,2), (2,2), or (1,1).

**THINKING 2: STRATEGY**

I should visit Clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,1). Since my current progress has me in row 1 and I want to move towards row 3, I need to consider the available moves that will help me reach row 3 efficiently.

**THINKING 3: EVALUATION**

Let's evaluate each available move:

* Move to (0,2): This move would take me away from row 1 and might block future paths.
* Move to (2,2): This move is close to Clue 2 but doesn't get me closer to it directly. It also creates a possibility for backtracking in the future.
* Move to (1,1): This move gets me one step closer to Clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths.

**THINKING 4: DECISION**

Considering the available moves and their implications on completing the puzzle efficiently, I decide to move to (1,1).

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 17:44:20,820 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,1) with 11 cells filled out of 25. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, and my current position is not directly next to any of them.
2. STRATEGY:
The next clue I should visit is clue 3, which is located at position (2,4). However, since it's already been visited as part of the current path (2,4) -> (1,4), we must backtrack or find an alternative route.
3. EVALUATION:
For each available move, let's consider their pros and cons:

- **(0,1)**: Moving up-left would put me in a safer position but does not help in reaching clue 3 directly.
- **(2,1)**: Moving down-right would take me closer to the path I need to complete, but it might block some future moves or be inefficient.
- **(1,0)**: Moving left would not move me towards clue 3 and feels like a "dead" move in this context.

**DECISION:**

Considering the available moves, moving down-right at position (2,1) could be beneficial as it gets us closer to completing our current path efficiently. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that (2,1) does not lead directly to clue 3 and might require unnecessary backtracking later on.

A better strategy would involve reaching a position where moving to clue 3 from there is more efficient or allows for the least amount of backtracking.

Given our constraints, let's choose **(0,1)** as it gets us into a safer position but does not obstruct any future paths.

**MOVE:** (0,1)

Let me know if this analysis is correct and we can proceed with the next step!

2025-12-10 17:44:27,963 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1) with a path length of 11/25 cells filled. The clues are located at positions (2,0), (3,1), and (2,4). My next goal is to visit clue 2 at position (3,1).

STRATEGY:
The next clue I should visit is clue 2 at position (3,1). To get there, I need to find the most efficient path.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Move (0,1): This would take me out of my current row and might make it harder to reach the higher-numbered clues.
* Move (2,1): This is a viable option as it moves me closer to clue 2. However, I need to consider if this will create any obstacles for future moves.
* Move (1,0): Moving down one column doesn't bring me any closer to clue 2.

DECISION:
Considering the available options, moving two rows up with (2,1) seems like a good choice. It puts me in a position that is relatively close to clue 2 and allows for further exploration of the board without immediately blocking future paths.

**THINKING:**
I am currently at position (2,1) with 12 out of 25 cells filled. Looking at the board, I can see that clue 4 is not yet visited and it's located at position (0,3). However, visiting clue 4 now would not bring me closer to any future clues in ascending order.

**STRATEGY:**
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,1). This will allow me to continue the path in ascending order and get closer to the highest numbered clue.

**EVALUATION:**
From my current position (2,1), I have two available moves: (2,0) or stay where I am. If I move to (2,0), I would be revisiting a cell that's already been filled by clue 1. Staying at (2,1) doesn't bring me any closer to the next clue.

**DECISION:**
The best decision is to stay put and plan my next move carefully.

MOVE: (2,1)

I will now re-evaluate the board and consider my next steps.

From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:44:43,824 - INFO - Here are my step-by-step solutions:

THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) with 12/25 cells filled. I can see that I've already visited clue 3 at position (2,4), and the next clue number in ascending order is 4. Clue 4 is not visible on the current board state, but based on the given coordinates, it's likely located in a top-left or center position. However, considering the rules of the puzzle, I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, so my next goal is to find and visit clue 2.

STRATEGY:
Clue 2 is located at position (3,1), which is my current available move's coordinate. My strategy is to move towards clue 2 first, fill any empty cells between clues as needed, and then continue the path in ascending order of clue numbers.

EVALUATION:
The only available next moves are (2,0) and (2,4). However, moving to (2,0) would take me away from my goal of visiting clue 2 at position (3,1), while moving to (2,4) would not bring me closer to clue 2 either. Therefore, neither option is optimal.

DECISION:
Considering the evaluation above and the given board state, I will choose not to move to either (2,0) or (2,4). Instead, I'll focus on analyzing the next available moves from my current position.

 MOVE: (2,1)

2025-12-10 17:44:52,758 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) with 12 cells filled out of 25. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, but I also want to make sure my path doesn't block any potential future moves or leave me stuck.

STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit Clue 3, which is located at position (2,4). However, since I'm already on the row with Clue 3, I can consider moving closer to it instead of going directly there. Since my current path order is [1], [2] for clues, and [11], [10], etc. are filled cells from previous moves.

EVALUATION:
From position (2,1), my available next moves are:

* Moving up: (1,1)
* Moving right: (2,2)

Pros and cons of each move:

Moving up to (1,1):
* Pros: gets me closer to Clue 3 and opens up the possibility of moving towards it later.
* Cons: might limit my options for filling in the path leading up to Clue 4 if I need to go back.

Moving right to (2,2):
* Pros: keeps me on the row with Clue 3 and gives more flexibility for future moves.
* Cons: doesn't get me closer to Clue 3 as quickly and might leave a potential dead end.

DECISION:
Considering my options, I will move right to (2,2) because it maintains flexibility and allows me to keep moving in the same direction towards Clue 3 without blocking any potential paths.

2025-12-10 17:45:04,656 - INFO - Here's my thought process:

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (2,2) on a 5x5 board, having filled 13 out of 25 cells. My current path is: (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end my path at the highest numbered clue.

2. **STRATEGY:** My next move should be to visit Clue 4, which is not visible on the board yet. Since I'm stuck, let's analyze our current situation.

3. **EVALUATION:**

Looking at the available moves from (2,2), we can consider moving left (L), right (R), up (U), or down (D). However, since we are looking for the best possible next move that will help us progress towards Clue 4, let's evaluate each option:

- L: Moving to (1,2) would bring me closer to a potential path to Clue 4, but it might limit my future options.
- R: Moving to (2,3) is not an available choice since we have visited Clue 3 at position (2,4).
- U: Moving up doesn't help progress towards any clues that are not yet discovered.
- D: Similarly, moving down doesn't lead us closer to any future clue locations.

Given these options and their implications on the rest of our path, let's try to find a direction that is likely to give us more flexibility for the next steps.

**DECISION:** The best move from (2,2) seems to be moving left into position (1,2). This allows me to potentially move up towards Clue 4 while also keeping my options open in other directions.

**MOVE:**
(1,2)

2. **STRATEGY:** My next move should be to visit Clue 4, which is not visible on the board yet. Since I'm stuck, let's analyze our current situation.

3. **EVALUATION:**

Looking at the available moves from (2,2), we can consider moving left (L), right (R), up (U), or down (D). However, since we are looking for the best possible next move that will help us progress towards Clue 4, let's evaluate each option:

**THINKING:**
I am currently at position (2,2) with 13/25 cells filled. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, so my next clue is Clue 3 located at position (2,4). However, since we are already at (2,2), moving directly to (2,4) would skip Clue 2, which is located at position (3,1). Therefore, I need to visit Clue 2 first.

**STRATEGY:**
My next clue number should be Clue 2, which is located at position (3,1).

**EVALUATION:**
From my current position (2,2), the available moves are:

* (2,0): Moving left would take us away from the target clues and block future paths.
* (3,2): Moving right to Clue 2's row is a possible option.

**DECISION:**
The move to (3,2) gets me closer to Clue 2 without blocking any future paths. It also opens up possibilities for moving further right to reach Clue 3.

2025-12-10 17:45:12,149 - INFO - **
I am currently at position (2,2) with 13/25 cells filled. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, so my next clue is Clue 3 located at position (2,4). However, since we are already at (2,2), moving directly to (2,4) would skip Clue 2, which is located at position (3,1). Therefore, I need to visit Clue 2 first.

**STRATEGY:**
My next clue number should be Clue 2, which is located at position (3,1).

**EVALUATION:**
From my current position (2,2), the available moves are:

* (2,0): Moving left would take us away from the target clues and block future paths.
* (3,2): Moving right to Clue 2's row is a possible option.
* (1,2): Moving down-left would not bring us closer to Clue 2.

**DECISION:**
The move to (3,2) gets me closer to Clue 2 without blocking any future paths. It also opens up possibilities for moving further right to reach Clue 3.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 17:45:20,305 - INFO - Here's my solution:

**THINKING:**
1. ANALYSIS: I'm currently at position (2,2) with a path of 13/25 cells filled. Looking at the board, I can see that I've already visited several clues and need to visit more.

2. STRATEGY: Since I need to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path, I should aim to reach the next clue number as soon as possible. However, considering my current position is not directly adjacent to any unvisited clue number, I need to evaluate the available moves carefully.

3. EVALUATION:
- Moving north from (2,2) takes me to an empty cell at (1,2), but this doesn't get me closer to a new clue number.
- Moving south from (2,2) is not possible since it's out of bounds.
- Moving east or west would take me away from the potential path to future clues.

**EVALUATION CONTINUED:**
Given my analysis above, I see that there are no immediate moves available that get me closer to a new clue number. However, I can try moving north and then evaluate further.

**DECISION:**
Since moving north gets me out of the way for potential future paths and doesn't block any future options, it's a safe choice. Now, I need to reassess my position and strategy considering this move.

**MOVE: (1,2)**

2025-12-10 17:45:32,669 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 2 out of 25 cells. The path taken so far is from (0,0) -> (0,1). My goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path, visiting each clue number in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 2, which should be located at position (0,2).

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (1,1) gets me closer to the top row and potentially sets up for future moves towards Clue 2.
* Moving to (0,2) places me directly on the next clue, but this might limit my future options.

4. DECISION:
Considering both pros and cons, I think moving to (1,1) is a better choice because it provides more flexibility in future moves.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:45:40,171 - INFO - Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1) with 2/25 cells filled. I need to visit clue number 3 next.
The current path taken is (0,0) -> (0,1).

2. STRATEGY:
Since the next clue number is 3, and there are no clues in row 0 or column 1 (other than the one at position (0,0)), I need to move horizontally or vertically to reach a new clue.

3. EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (1,1) or (0,2). Let's evaluate each option:

* Moving to (1,1): This would get me closer to the potential location of clue 3 in row 1.
* Moving to (0,2): This would take me away from the current row and might not be as efficient.

4. DECISION:
Considering the next clue is likely to be in row 1 or column 2, I'll choose the move that gets me closer to these areas. Therefore, moving to (1,1) seems like a good starting point.

**MOVE:**
(1,1)

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is 4. Looking at the available moves, both options seem promising since they don't block any immediate paths.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

1. (1,2) - This move would put me one row up from the current position but doesn't get me closer to clue 4.
   Pros: Doesn't immediately block a future path.
   Cons: Not a step towards visiting clue 4 directly.

2. (0,3) - This move would place me one column to the right of the current position and gets me closer to potentially finding an empty cell between clues or moving further up to visit clue 4.

DECISION:
Based on the available options, I'll choose the move that gets me closer to visiting clue 4. Moving (0,3) allows for more flexibility in terms of future moves while also keeping my current path relatively straight and clear from potential blocks.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,3) with a filled path of (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3). I have visited clue 1 and need to visit the remaining clues in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number I should visit is 2. However, I don't see any indication of its location on the current board state. We know that there's a clue 2 in one of the cells, but we don't have its exact position yet.

3. EVALUATION:
Available Next Moves: (1,3), (0,4)

Pros for moving to (1,3):
- It is a valid move within the grid.
Cons for moving to (1,3):
- It doesn't get me closer to clue 2.

Pros for moving to (0,4):
- It is also a valid move.
- It allows me to potentially fill in more cells between clues.

However, we don't have enough information about the board state yet. 

We need to revisit clue 1 and see if there's any hidden path or clue that we can uncover next.

4. DECISION:
Considering our current situation and available moves, it seems like we are focusing on filling in empty cells between clues rather than getting closer to clue 2. In order to make a more informed decision, we need to gather more information about the board state. 

For now, I think moving back to (0,1) might be beneficial.

MOVE: (0,1)

Note that the response doesn't contain a new path from previous MOVE.

2025-12-10 17:46:04,646 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 17:46:04,646 - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,3) with a filled path of (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3). I have visited clue 1 and need to visit the remaining clues in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number I should visit is 2. However, I don't see any indication of its location on the current board state. We know that there's a clue 2 in one of the cells, but we don't have its exact position yet.

3. EVALUATION:
Available Next Moves: (1,3), (0,4)

Pros for moving to (1,3):
- It is a valid move within the grid.
Cons for moving to (1,3):
- It doesn't get me closer to clue 2.

Pros for moving to (0,4):
- It is also a valid move.
- It allows me to potentially fill in more cells between clues.

However, we don't have enough information about the board state yet. 

We need to revisit clue 1 and see if there's any hidden path or clue that we can uncover next.

4. DECISION:
Considering our current situation and available moves, it seems like we are focusing on filling in empty cells between clues rather than getting closer to clue 2. In order to make a more informed decision, we need to gather more information about the board state. 

For now, I think moving back to (0,1) might be beneficial.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:46:14,734 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,3) on a 5x5 grid, having filled 4 out of 25 cells so far. My path taken is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3). I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (1,1).

2. STRATEGY:
Since the next clue number is 2 and it's located at (1,1), my goal is to get there without revisiting any cells or blocking future paths.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

**Available Moves:** (1,3) and (0,4)

Pros of moving to (1,3):
- It's a horizontal move that keeps me on the same row as my current position.
- It gets me closer to clue 2.

Cons:
- Moving horizontally might not be the most efficient way to get to clue 2 at (1,1).

Pros of moving to (0,4):
- It's a vertical move that takes me down to the next row.
- However, this move is blocked because there are already cells filled in that direction.

**DECISION:**
I choose to move to (1,3) since it gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. This move also keeps me on the same row as my current position, making it easier to navigate towards clue 2 at (1,1).

**MOVE:** (1,3)

Current Position: (0,3)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3)

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:46:39,094 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) with a total progress of 5/25 cells filled. The current path taken is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3). Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (1,1).

STRATEGY:
My goal is to visit all clues in ascending order and fill all 25 cells in one continuous path. Since I'm currently at position (1,3), I should try to move towards clue 2 at (1,1) while keeping the rest of the puzzle in mind.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Move to (2,3): This would take me away from the main diagonal and potentially create a path that's harder to complete. However, it might also leave room for future moves.
* Move to (1,2): This would get me closer to clue 2 but still leaves some distance between us. It could be a good option if I need to move diagonally later.
* Move to (1,4): Similar to the previous option, this gets me close to clue 2 but also keeps me on the same row as before.

DECISION:
Considering my goal of visiting all clues in ascending order and keeping the puzzle open for future moves, I choose to move to (1,2). This position is relatively central and allows me to get closer to clue 2 while leaving options for subsequent moves.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,2) and I've filled 6 out of 25 cells in one continuous path. Looking at the current game state, I have visited clue 1, which is located at position (0,0).

2. STRATEGY:
Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, my next goal is to visit clue 2.

3. EVALUATION:
From my current position (1,2), I can move to either (2,2) or (1,1). To evaluate these moves, let's consider their pros and cons:

**Move (2,2):**
Pros: This move keeps me in the same column as clue 2, which is located at (2,1).
Cons: If I make this move, I may end up backtracking later to visit clue 3.

**Move (1,1):**
Pros: This move gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths.
Cons: None immediately apparent.

4. DECISION:
Based on the evaluation above, moving to (1,1) seems like the best option. It sets me up for an efficient path towards visiting all clues in ascending order.

**MOVE:** (1,1)

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,2) with a filled path of 6 out of 25 cells. The current path is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2). I need to visit the remaining clues in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is 7, but it's not clear where its location is. However, since I'm already at position (1,2), visiting clue 6 first might be a good idea as it's relatively close by and could help me make progress towards the higher-numbered clues.

3. EVALUATION:
Available next moves are (2,2) or (1,1). Let's evaluate each option:

* Move to (2,2): This move would bring me closer to potential future paths but doesn't directly help with visiting clue 6.
* Move to (1,1): This move gets me closer to the left edge of the board and could potentially provide more space for maneuvering in the future.

4. DECISION:
Considering my current position and the available moves, I think moving to (1,1) is a good choice as it:

* Gets me closer to potential future paths
* Provides more space for maneuvering

2025-12-10 17:47:03,923 - INFO - I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

**STEP 1**

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 6 out of 25 cells. I need to visit clue 5 next, which is at position (3,3). From my current position, I have two available moves: (2,2) or (1,1).

**STEP 2**

STRATEGY:
The clue number I should visit next is indeed clue 5, located at position (3,3). To get there efficiently, I need to plan my path carefully.

**EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES**

1. **(2,2)**: This move would get me closer to the row where clue 5 is located. However, it might block a future path or create an unnecessary detour.
2. **(1,1)**: This move would put me in a more central position and potentially allow for easier movement towards clue 5.

**DECISION**

Considering my current position and the available moves, I choose to make a move that sets me up for potential future paths. Therefore, I'll choose:

MOVE: (1,3)

The reason is that by moving to (1,3), I'm not blocking any direct path to clue 5 and might be able to find an efficient route later on.

2025-12-10 17:47:03,934 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 17:47:03,934 - INFO - I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 6 out of 25 cells. I need to visit clue 5 next, which is at position (3,3). From my current position, I have two available moves: (2,2) or (1,1).

**STEP 2**

STRATEGY:
The clue number I should visit next is indeed clue 5, located at position (3,3). To get there efficiently, I need to plan my path carefully.

**EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES**

1. **(2,2)**: This move would get me closer to the row where clue 5 is located. However, it might block a future path or create an unnecessary detour.
2. **(1,1)**: This move would put me in a more central position and potentially allow for easier movement towards clue 5.

**DECISION**

Considering my current position and the available moves, I choose to make a move that sets me up for potential future paths. Therefore, I'll choose:

2025-12-10 17:47:12,816 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0) and I've filled 1 out of 25 cells. The clue number to visit next is 2, which is located at position (2,2). From my current position, I have two available moves: (1,0) or (0,1).

STRATEGY:
I need to visit all the clues in ascending order, and since I'm already on the starting point (clue 1), my next goal is to reach clue 2 at position (2,2). Visiting clue 2 will allow me to continue the path in a more organized way.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Move (1,0): Pros: I'm moving down, which gets me closer to the general direction of clue 2. Cons: This might not be the most efficient route since it doesn't get me closer to clue 2 as much as a diagonal or horizontal move would.
* Move (0,1): Pros: I'm moving right, which is a more straightforward approach and could potentially set up for an easier path to clue 2 in the future. Cons: It might not be as direct as some other moves.

DECISION:
Considering my goal of visiting all clues in ascending order, and looking ahead to the potential paths that would allow me to visit all clues efficiently, I decide to move (0,1) to get closer to the right edge of the board.

2025-12-10 17:47:21,074 - INFO - Here's my solution:

THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 2 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from Clue 1 at position (0,0). I need to move towards the next available clue, which is Clue 2 at position (2,2).

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to reach Clue 2, as it is the only other clue provided so far. To do this efficiently, I should try to move horizontally or vertically towards that location.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (1,1) and (0,2). The pros of moving to (1,1) are that it gets me closer to Clue 2 and doesn't block any potential future paths. The con is that I'll need to move again to reach the column where Clue 2 is located. Moving to (0,2) would also get me closer to Clue 2, but it might limit my options for moving horizontally in the next step.

DECISION:
Based on the evaluation above, I believe that moving to (1,1) is a better choice because it sets up a more flexible path towards reaching Clue 2. This move allows me to consider both horizontal and vertical paths in future steps.

MOVE: (1,1)

3. EVALUATION:
- Available Move 1: (2,1)
	* Pros: This move directly goes towards clue 2.
	* Cons: It's a significant horizontal jump without considering other potential paths or future implications.
- Available Move 2: (1,0)
	* Pros: This move goes down from the current position, creating space for future moves and potentially allowing me to access higher rows more easily.
	* Cons: It might not directly contribute to reaching clue 2 but could be part of a larger strategy.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2. STRATEGY: Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue (which is not specified yet), my next step should be to find a path to clue 2, which is located at position (2,2). However, before visiting clue 2, I need to determine if there's an optimal path that sets me up for future moves.

2025-12-10 17:47:55,438 - INFO - Here's my analysis:

THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) with a progress of 6/25 cells filled. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, and the next one is Clue 3. However, there are no direct paths from Clue 2 at (2,2) to any other clues without revisiting previously visited cells or going out of bounds.

STRATEGY:
Given that Clue 3's location is not explicitly provided but must be in ascending order after Clue 2, it's reasonable to assume the next clue will be above or below Clue 2. Since there are empty cells between the current position (2,1) and potential locations for Clue 3, I should choose a move that fills these gaps.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (3,1) would fill an empty cell but does not get me closer to a specific clue.
* Moving to (2,2), which is where Clue 2 is located, seems promising because it allows me to revisit and assess the clue's surroundings for potential paths to the next clues.

DECISION:
Considering that I need to visit all clues in ascending order and have already visited some cells between them, moving to the location of Clue 2 at (2,2) will allow me to reassess my path and make informed decisions about future moves. This move also has a clear objective: visiting the next clue.

2025-12-10 17:48:07,727 - INFO - Here are my step-by-step solutions:

**THINKING STEP 1: ANALYSIS**

I am currently at position (2,2) with a filled path of (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). I have visited clues 1 and 2 in ascending order. My current situation is that I need to visit the remaining clues in ascending order.

**THINKING STEP 2: STRATEGY**

The next clue I should visit is clue 3, which is located at position (0,4).

**THINKING STEP 3: EVALUATION**

Available moves are:
- (1,2) - but this would not get me closer to clue 3
- (3,2) - could potentially block future paths if I need to move down
- (2,3) - would bring me closer to the center of the board and allow me to reach clue 3 more easily

**THINKING STEP 4: DECISION**

I choose to move (2,3).

MOVE: (2,3)

**THINKING STEP 5**

Now that I've moved to position (2,3), my next goal is to visit clue 4 at position (1,4). From here, available moves are:
- (2,4) - would bring me closer to the edge of the board and allow me to reach clue 4 more easily
- (1,3) - could potentially block future paths if I need to move down

**THINKING STEP 6: EVALUATION**

I choose to move (2,4).

MOVE: (2,4)

**THINKING STEP 7**

Now that I've moved to position (2,4), my next goal is to visit clue 5 at position (3,1). From here, available moves are:
- (2,1) - would bring me closer to clue 5
- (3,0) - could potentially block future paths if I need to move right

**THINKING STEP 8: DECISION**

I choose to move (2,1).

MOVE: (2,1)

2025-12-10 17:48:15,214 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,3) with 8 out of 25 cells filled. My goal is to visit all clues in ascending order, starting from clue 1, which is already visited. The next clue I need to visit is clue 3.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is clue 3, but its location is not provided yet. However, I can infer that it will be located at a position not previously mentioned (not (0,0) or (2,2)). Since the board is 5x5 and we have already filled some cells, there are restrictions on where clue 3 could potentially be.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Move to (1,3): This would take me away from the middle of the board but doesn't necessarily block any future paths.
* Move to (3,3): This would put me at a corner of the board and might limit my options for the next clue.
* Move to (2,4): This move moves me to the right, potentially putting more space between us and clue 3.

DECISION:
I choose to move to (1,3) as it keeps me relatively central on the board while still allowing flexibility for future moves.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,3) with a filled path of 8 out of 25 cells. My current situation shows that I need to visit all the remaining clues in ascending order, starting from the next available clue.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number is 3. However, clue 3's location is not given explicitly, so we should look for it based on the previous moves and the given path. Since clue 1 was at position (0,0) and clue 2 was at position (2,2), we can deduce that the next clue will be in a similar pattern.

Given my current progress and path taken, I assume the next possible clue locations could be either on the next row or column of the previous clues. Since clue 1 is at (0,0) and clue 2 at (2,2), logically, the next one should be in the same diagonal direction. Thus, it would make sense for clue 3 to be located directly above clue 2.

Therefore, I believe clue 3's location is at position (2,1).

3. EVALUATION:
- For move (1,3): This move doesn't seem optimal because moving up or diagonally left could bring me closer to visiting the next clues in order without blocking any future paths.
  
- For move (3,3): This would essentially be a step back since it does not follow the ascending order of clues and moves us away from potential clue locations that are higher.

- For move (2,4): Similar to moving up but doesn't seem as promising as evaluating other options first.

However, my initial assumption about clue 3's location might need adjustment based on available information. Given the puzzle rules, I should look for a clue in an ascending order from previous clues' locations.

Considering this, and the next moves given (1,3), (3,3), or (2,4), let me reassess my strategy:

Given that we are following the path of visiting all clues in ascending order and considering my current position at (2,3) with clue 2 being at (2,2), a potential mistake was made in assuming clue 3's location. 

Since I am currently two cells away from the row where clue 2 is located and need to visit higher numbered clues next, visiting clue 4 would logically be the next step if it follows the ascending order of locations as the previous clues have.

The available next moves (1,3), (3,3), or (2,4) are evaluated considering the correct strategy. Since I am aiming for visiting all clues in ascending order and need to move forward and not backward:

- For move (1,3): This is a step towards the potential location of clue 4, given that we're moving upwards from clue 2's location.

- For move (3,3): This seems less optimal as it doesn't align with moving directly to higher numbered clues following the ascending order of previous clues' locations.

- For move (2,4): Similar reasoning; it does not follow the direct path towards visiting clue 4 in an ascending order from clue 2's location.

Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:48:40,366 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) with a filled path of 9 cells out of 25. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, so my next destination is clue number 2, which is located at position (2,2). My current situation shows that I have filled the top row and some parts of the second row, but there are empty cells between clues that need to be filled.

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue number 2 at position (2,2).

EVALUATION:
The available moves are: (0,3), (1,2), and (1,4). Let's evaluate each option:

* (0,3): Moving down would take me away from my current row and potentially block future paths. It might be a good move if I needed to access the bottom row quickly.
* (1,2): This move gets me closer to clue number 2 at position (2,2) but doesn't necessarily improve my overall situation. However, it does create an opportunity for future moves in the second column.
* (1,4): Moving right would take me away from the second row and potentially block access to clue number 3.

DECISION:
The best move is (1,2), as it gets me closer to clue number 2 without immediately blocking any potential paths. This decision also leaves open possibilities for future moves in the second column.

2025-12-10 17:48:49,485 - INFO - Here's my solution:

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) with 10 out of 25 cells filled. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, and my next clue is number 3. According to the puzzle rules, I must never revisit a cell I've already been to, so I should aim for a path that will allow me to reach the highest numbered clue efficiently.

STRATEGY:
My next clue is at position (1,3), but it's not available yet since I need to fill some empty cells. Since my current position is (1,2) and I have already visited (0,0), (1,1), and (2,2), the best course of action would be to move towards clue 3 while keeping an eye on future moves.

EVALUATION:
For each available next move from (1,2), here are the pros and cons:

- Move to (0,2): This move doesn't get me closer to clue 3 at position (1,3) and might limit my options for reaching higher-numbered clues later on.
  
- Move to (2,2): This move will help fill in a necessary step towards reaching the highest numbered clue but is not directly adjacent to the next clue.

- Move to (1,1): This move would put me one position away from clue 3 and allows for possible future paths to other clues.

DECISION:
Given my current situation and the options available, I'll choose the move that gets me closest to clue 3 while keeping an eye on the overall puzzle board.

I am currently at position (1,2) with 10 cells filled out of 25. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order while filling empty cells between them as needed.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

My current position is (1,2), and I have already visited clues 1 and 2. Clue 3 is still unvisited. The board has a mix of filled and empty cells, and there are multiple paths to explore.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

The next available clue is 3. However, its exact location is not specified in the problem statement yet. Since we have to move horizontally or vertically, our aim is to reach clue locations while avoiding revisiting any cells and filling empty spaces efficiently.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Available moves from (1,2) are:
- (0,2): This move would be a good way to start building a path towards potential future clue locations while not blocking paths.
- Other options might take us away from our current vertical alignment with clues 1 and 2 or block future possibilities.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Based on the available moves, going to (0,2) seems like the most promising starting point for our next step. It allows us to build a path while keeping clue locations in mind without blocking any potential future paths.

MOVE: (0,2)

Now that we've made this move, let's evaluate where we stand and make further decisions based on new information:

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 4]   .    .    . 
[ 3] [.  ] [10] [ 9]   .

  .    4    .    3    . 
  2    .    .    .    . 

From here, we have a new perspective on the puzzle. We should evaluate our next move by considering where clue 3 is located and how to proceed with visiting all clues in ascending order while keeping empty cells filled between them efficiently.

Please let me continue solving it from this point if you need further steps!

Given the available options, moving to (0,3) is the best choice at this point because it keeps my path open and allows for future flexibility in navigating towards higher-numbered clues.

MOVE: (0,3)

I am currently at position (0,2) with a progress of 11/25 cells filled. The visual board shows that I've visited clue numbers 1 and 2, and some intermediate cells in between.

2. STRATEGY:
Next, I need to visit the next available clue number, which is clue 3. However, since I'm currently at position (0,2) and clue 2 is already visited, I should look for a move that will bring me closer to clue 3 without revisiting any cells.

I am currently at position (0,4) with a filled path of 13/25 cells. My current situation is that I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, starting from the next available number after 2, which is 3. Clue 3's location is not provided, but we can deduce its possible locations by analyzing the given board state and considering potential paths. Given my current position (0,4) and the filled path, I have a few options for where to move next.

STRATEGY:
Considering the ascending order of clue numbers, I need to visit the next highest numbered clue after 2, which is 3. However, since we do not know its exact location yet, we will focus on exploring possible locations and future implications.

EVALUATION:
The available next moves are (1,4). Evaluating each option:

* Moving to (1,4) directly would help me explore the board's top-left area, which is relatively unexplored. It doesn't block any potential paths or clues in the immediate vicinity but might limit future options.

DECISION:
Considering the given situation and available moves, moving to position (1,4) seems like a reasonable choice. It does not immediately help me find clue 3's location but allows me to explore more of the board without restricting my future options.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:49:38,426 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,4) with a path of 14/25 cells filled. I can see that I've visited most of the clues in the first three rows, and now I need to focus on filling in the remaining cells.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue I should visit is Clue 3, which is located at position (1,3). It's relatively close to my current position, and visiting it will help me fill in some of the surrounding empty cells.

3. EVALUATION:
From my current position (1,4), I have two available moves: (2,4) or (1,3). Moving to (2,4) would take me away from Clue 3, but it also leaves open a path for future exploration. On the other hand, moving to (1,3) puts me directly on top of Clue 3 and starts filling in some of the surrounding empty cells.

4. DECISION:
I'll choose the move that gets me closer to completing the puzzle, which is visiting Clue 3 at position (1,3).

**MOVE:** (1,3)

Next step: I'll fill in Clue 3 at position (1,3) and then evaluate my next moves to continue filling in the board.

2025-12-10 17:49:53,524 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (1,4), having filled 14 out of 25 cells in my path so far.
2. **STRATEGY:** Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, and Clue 2 is already visited at position (2,2), the next highest numbered clue I haven't visited yet is not present on the board. Therefore, I should visit the next available clue number. Given that my current position has a number '14', it seems like I've visited all consecutive clues up to this point and now need to fill in the empty spaces between them.
3. **EVALUATION:** For each available move:
	* Moving to (2,4) would allow me to potentially visit the empty space above the clue numbers ( Clue 1 or 5 ) but might block some future paths due to limited horizontal and vertical space left on the board.
	* Moving to (2,3) allows for more flexibility in terms of potential moves later on since it doesn't limit me vertically.

**DECISION:**

Considering the pros and cons, moving to (2,4) offers the possibility of connecting two paths I haven't visited yet. Since I am at position (1,4), this move keeps my row constant while allowing for an upward movement. This could help in filling some missing numbers efficiently by potentially creating a pathway from '14' to either another high number or Clue 2.

I am currently at position (0,0) with a single cell filled, which is Clue 1. According to the rules, I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order. The next clue to visit is Clue 2, and its location needs to be determined.

Upon reviewing the board layout, I see that there are empty cells around Clue 1 at position (0,0). I can move horizontally or vertically to fill these cells between clues as needed.

My goal is to reach Clue 2 next. Considering the board layout, Clue 2 must be located in one of the four adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), or (1,1).

EVALUATION:

* Available move (1,0): If I move to (1,0), I'll be filling an empty cell between Clue 1 and potential future clue locations. However, this move doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2.
* Available move (0,1): Moving to (0,1) gets me directly adjacent to a potential location for Clue 2.

DECISION:
Given the available moves and considering the goal of reaching Clue 2 next, I will choose the move that places me in an optimal position for finding Clue 2.

2025-12-10 17:50:10,165 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step solution:

**THINKING:**
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 2 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is not yet revealed but will be part of the ascending order sequence starting from clue 1.

**STRATEGY:**
Since I'm only two steps into the puzzle, my primary goal is to identify potential locations for clue 2 and set up a path that can accommodate future clues. Given the current state of the board, I should focus on moving horizontally or vertically to maximize flexibility.

**EVALUATION:**
I have two available moves: (1,1) or (0,2). Let's evaluate each option:

* **(1,1)**: Moving diagonally up-left would put me in a position that doesn't block any future paths and keeps the left edge of the board open. This move also sets up potential access to the second row.
* **(0,2)**: Moving right from (0,1) places me in a position where I'm two spaces away from the edge of the board, which might create difficulties for subsequent moves.

**DECISION:**
Considering the current state of the puzzle and available options, I choose to move diagonally up-left to maintain flexibility and set up potential access to future clues.

**MOVE:** (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:50:20,913 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 17:50:20,914 - INFO - THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,1) with 2/25 cells filled, which means I've just started my path from clue number 1 located at position (0,0). The current situation is that I need to visit all the remaining clues in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: My next move should be to a position that allows me to proceed with visiting the clues in sequence while also considering potential future moves and keeping track of the path taken so far.

3. EVALUATION:
- **Move (1,1)**:
  * Pros: It gets me closer to clue 2, which is located at position (1,0).
  * Cons: This move doesn't necessarily fill any cell or place a clue number but sets the stage for visiting the next clues.
  
- **Move (0,2)**:
  * Pros: By moving two spaces horizontally from my current position, I don't block potential vertical moves towards clue 3 and other future positions. It's an efficient way to start filling in cells or placing clue numbers without restricting movement.
  * Cons: Similar to the first move, it doesn't immediately fill a cell with a clue number but sets up for future moves efficiently.

4. DECISION:
Given that I need to visit all clues in ascending order and considering efficiency in setting up future moves, moving diagonally isn't an option (rule 5), so either horizontal or vertical is appropriate. Between the two options given, both seem to prepare for efficient movement towards clue 2 without immediately blocking other potential paths.

Considering the rules of the game, especially filling empty cells between clues as needed and keeping in mind that we're at a very early stage with only two filled cells, it makes sense to move in a direction that allows for flexibility. Both moves are promising, but given the need to prepare for visiting higher-numbered clues efficiently without immediately placing clue numbers or blocking paths, **MOVE: (0,2)** seems more strategic for setting up future movements.

2025-12-10 17:50:29,047 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,2) with a path of length 3 out of 25 cells filled.
2. STRATEGY: Next, I need to visit clue number 4, which is located at an unknown position. However, we can see that there are empty cells between the current position and the top-right corner. It's likely that clue 4 will be near the top-right corner.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves are (1,2) and (0,3). Let's evaluate each move:

a. (1,2):
	* Pros: Moves us up and to the right, potentially bringing us closer to clue 4.
	* Cons: We might end up being blocked by future clues or empty cells.

b. (0,3):
	* Pros: Keeps us on a horizontal line with the current position, which could help fill in more cells between clues 1 and 2.
	* Cons: May not bring us closer to clue 4 as quickly.

4. DECISION:
Based on the evaluation, moving up and to the right (1,2) is likely the best choice. It gives us flexibility to navigate around potential blocks while keeping us relatively close to the top-right corner where clue 4 might be located.

MOVE: (1,2)

Your turn! What's the next step?

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:50:44,027 - INFO - Let's break down the problem step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,2) with a path of length 5 out of 25 cells filled.
The visual board state is:
[ 1] [ 2] [ 3]   .    . 
  .    .  [ 4]   .    . 
  .    .  [ 5]   .    . 
  .    5    .    .    2 
  .    .    .    .    3 

**STRATEGY:**
Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, the next step is to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (0,4). However, this would require a significant detour. It's better to move towards Clue 2 or fill some empty cells first.

**EVALUATION:**
Available moves are:
- (3,2): Moving down might allow me to find a path to Clue 3 more easily.
- (2,1): Moving left could get me closer to the center and potentially create more options for future moves.
- (2,3): Moving right doesn't seem like an optimal choice as it wouldn't help with finding a path to Clue 3.

**DECISION:**
Considering that I want to keep my options open for future moves, moving left towards (2,1) seems the most promising. It's also worth noting that this move doesn't commit me to visiting Clues 2 and 3 in any specific order, allowing for more flexibility as we progress.

**MOVE:** 
(2,1)

Please let me know if I should proceed with the next step or if there are any errors in my reasoning.

I am currently at position (2,2) with a path length of 5/25 cells filled. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from clue 1. From my current position, I can see that there are two clues nearby: [3] and [4]. Since the next clue is clue number 6 (following clue 5), which is not visible from here, I will try to move towards the right or top to reach a higher numbered clue.

STRATEGY:
The next clue should be number 6. However, since I don't see it immediately, I'll aim for clues that are slightly lower in value but can potentially lead me closer to clue 6.

EVALUATION:

* Move (3,2): Moving right would take me towards the potential path of clue 5 and then possibly clue 6. However, this move doesn't guarantee reaching a higher numbered clue.
* Move (2,1): This move takes me away from the current path but gets closer to clues on the left side of the board. Since I need to visit lower-numbered clues before moving right, this seems like a viable option.
* Move (2,3): Moving up doesn't seem promising since it would take me further away from higher numbered clues.

DECISION:
Considering my current situation and the available moves, moving (2,1) is the best choice. It allows me to get closer to lower-numbered clues while keeping future possibilities open for reaching higher-numbered clues like clue 6.

2025-12-10 17:51:00,244 - INFO - Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,1) with 6 out of 25 cells filled. Looking at the board, I can see that I have a relatively clear path ahead. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order while avoiding revisiting any cells.

2. STRATEGY:
My next move should bring me closer to clue 2 (located at position (1,3)). Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, visiting clue 2 will be my top priority.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (1,1) would get me closer to the potential path to clue 2.
* Moving to (3,1) would put me two rows away from clue 2 and might require backtracking later on.
* Moving to (2,0) would take me off the main diagonal towards clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal of visiting all clue numbers in ascending order, moving closer to clue 2 is the best choice. The move to (1,1) allows for flexibility and doesn't block any future paths.

**MOVE:** (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:51:09,921 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step reasoning for solving the ZIP PUZZLE.

**THINKING 1:**
I am currently at position (2,1) with a filled path of (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1). I have visited clue 3 and need to continue visiting clues in ascending order. The current situation is that I am on the second row and first column of the third quadrant.

**STRATEGY:**
The next clue to visit should be clue number 4, which is located at an unknown position. However, since we're working with a standard coordinate grid, we can infer that it's likely in one of the adjacent cells or the cell diagonally opposite to my current location.

**EVALUATION:**
Given the available next moves (1,1), (3,1), and (2,0), let's evaluate each option:

* Move to (1,1): This gets me closer to potential locations for clue 4. It also opens up a new row for future exploration.
* Move to (3,1): This move takes me away from the center of the board but doesn't block any paths. However, it creates an opportunity for getting stuck in the corner later on.
* Move to (2,0): This is going backwards, which might be useful if we're trying to find a clue that's closer than initially thought.

**DECISION:**
Considering future implications and the need to keep exploring the center of the board, I'll choose the move that gets me closer to potential locations for clue 4. The optimal choice is:

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:51:18,355 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1) with 7/25 cells filled, which means I've visited 7 out of the 25 possible positions. My current path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1). To progress further, I need to visit the remaining clue numbers in ascending order.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is 8. However, there's no direct indication of its location on the board yet. But since we're moving from clue to clue, I'll assume that the path will lead me to it eventually. For now, my focus is on finding a suitable move that gets me closer to the next few clue locations while keeping future options open.

EVALUATION:
The available next moves are (1,0). I can only move horizontally or vertically, so I have limited options here. The (1,0) position is directly below my current location at (1,1).

DECISION:
Considering the limited options and trying to keep future paths open, I think it's best to move down to (2,1), which keeps me on a relatively central path while also getting closer to potential future clue locations. This move doesn't block any direct routes to the next few clues or create unnecessary dead ends.

THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (1,1) with a path length of 7 out of 25 cells filled. My current position is next to clue number 1 and 7.

2. STRATEGY: My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order. Since the highest numbered clue is at position (4,4), I should aim to get as close to it as possible while avoiding revisiting any cells. Next, I need to visit clue 8, which is located at an unknown position.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, I will consider the pros and cons:
	* Move to (0,1): This would get me closer to clue 1 but might limit my future options.
	* Move to (2,1): This would put me directly next to clue 7 and potentially create a pathway for visiting higher-numbered clues. However, it's not clear if this move is possible or whether there are empty cells between us that need to be filled first.

4. DECISION: Since I am currently at position (1,1) with the ability to move down to (2,1), this seems like a promising option. It allows me to get closer to clue 7 and potentially create a pathway for visiting higher-numbered clues.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

**THINKING**

1. **ANALYSIS**: I am currently at position (1,1) with a filled path of 7/25 cells. The current position is near clue number 6.
2. **STRATEGY**: Since the goal is to visit all clues in ascending order, my next target should be clue number 8. However, there are no direct paths from (1,1) to any higher-numbered clues without revisiting a cell or moving diagonally. Therefore, I'll focus on finding a path that allows me to reach clue number 7 first and then potentially move towards clue number 8.
3. **EVALUATION**: For each available next move, considering the pros and cons:
	* Moving to (2,1) is not possible since it's already blocked by a filled cell.
	* Moving to (0,1) could be an option but might limit future paths or create dead-ends.
	* Moving to (1,0) seems like the most promising choice as it doesn't block any potential paths and keeps my options open for the next move.

**DECISION**: I'll choose the move that allows me to progress towards higher-numbered clues while keeping my options open.

**MOVE:** (1,0)

2025-12-10 17:52:25,107 - INFO - Here are my step-by-step solutions:

**Step 1**

THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,3) and I've filled 1 out of 25 cells. The goal is to visit all clues in ascending order. Clue 2 is located at position (3,2). From my current position, the available moves are: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), or (3,4).

MOVE: (3,2)

**Step 2**

From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 17:52:34,992 - INFO - Here's my step-by-step reasoning for solving the ZIP PUZZLE:

**Step 1: ANALYSIS**

I am currently at position (3,2) and have filled 2/25 cells. The current path taken is (3,3) -> (3,2), indicating that I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order. My goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path.

**STRATEGY**

The next clue number to visit is Clue 1 at position (3,3). However, since I've already visited Clue 1 as part of the initial path taken, my next goal should be to move towards Clue 2. Clue 2 is located at position (3,2), which is not a valid clue number for me to visit again.

Upon reviewing the board, I realize that I need to backtrack or move horizontally/vertically to reach the next available clue number in ascending order. The nearest possible clue number is Clue 2 with number '5' which is at position (1,2) 

**EVALUATION**

Available moves are:

* (2,2): Moving down would take me away from the goal of visiting higher-numbered clues.
* (4,2): Moving up would not get me closer to Clue 3 or any other clue in ascending order.
* (3,1): Moving left is a possible move, but it's essential to ensure that I'm getting closer to the next available clue number.

**DECISION**

Considering the pros and cons of each available move, I decide to choose (3,1) as my next move. This move keeps me on track with visiting higher-numbered clues in ascending order and avoids revisiting cells already filled.

**MOVE**

(3,1)

2025-12-10 17:52:54,359 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,1) with a filled path of 3/25 cells. The clue numbers are: Clue 1 at (3,3), Clue 2 at (3,2), and Clue 3 is already visited at (1,2). The next clue to visit is Clue 4, but its location is not given yet. I need to find a path that allows me to visit all the cells in ascending order.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit is indeed Clue 4. However, since we don't know its exact position yet, our strategy should focus on reaching an empty cell where Clue 4 could potentially be located. Given the available moves (2,1), (4,1), and (3,0), I need to evaluate each option.

EVALUATION:
For each move:

* Move to (2,1): This would take me down one row from my current position at (3,1). It doesn't block any future paths but also doesn't seem to bring me closer to the next clue location. Since we don't know where Clue 4 is located, this option might not be ideal.
* Move to (4,1): This would take me down two rows from my current position at (3,1), which could potentially put me closer to an empty cell where Clue 4 might be. However, it does leave fewer options for moving horizontally or vertically if I need to backtrack or go up.
* Move to (3,0): This move would take me one column to the left from my current position at (3,1). It doesn't seem directly related to getting closer to Clue 4's potential location but is a safe option that keeps us on the same row for now.

DECISION:
Given the available moves and considering future implications, moving down to (4,1) seems like the most promising step. This move maintains flexibility in case we need to backtrack or adjust our path later while still keeping us close to the potential clue locations.

2025-12-10 17:53:01,109 - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (4,1) with 4/25 cells filled. My path taken so far is (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1). The visual board state shows that I've visited clues 1 and 2.

2. STRATEGY: Next, I need to visit clue number 3, which is located at position (1,2).

3. EVALUATION:

Available next moves are (4,0) or (4,2).
Pros of moving to (4,0):
- It doesn't block any potential future paths.
Cons:
- It doesn't directly bring me closer to clue 3.

Pros of moving to (4,2):
- It brings me closer to clue 3.
Cons:
- However, it might limit my future options since I'll be moving away from the central part of the board.

4. DECISION: Based on the strategy and evaluation, I choose the move that gets me closer to the goal without blocking potential paths.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 17:53:10,284 - INFO - Here's my solution:

**THINKING:**

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (4,2) with a filled path of 5 cells out of 25. The current path is (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2). I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and fill empty cells between clues.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is 5, which is not yet indicated on the board but will be filled as we progress. However, looking at the available moves from my current position (4,2), I see that I'm near Clue 3 and can easily access it with a small adjustment.

3. EVALUATION:
From the current position (4,2), I have two available moves: (4,1) or (4,3). Moving to (4,1) will take me away from potential future paths that involve filling cells between Clue 3 and my next destination. On the other hand, moving to (4,3) is more promising as it keeps me close to the current path and allows flexibility for future moves.

**DECISION:**
Considering my goal of visiting all clues in ascending order, moving to (4,3) offers a better opportunity to progress while maintaining flexibility for future moves. This choice doesn't limit potential paths that might require revisiting cells between Clues 1 and 2 or between other future clue numbers.

**MOVE:** (4,3)

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to make adjustments!

I am currently at position (4,2) with a progress of 5/25 cells filled. I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order. So far, I've visited clues 1 and 3. The next clue number is 2. According to the clue locations, clue 2 is situated at (3,2), but that's already been visited as part of my path.
