Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,2), which is Clue 1's location. The current path taken is just this one cell. Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, the next clue number to visit is 2. According to the board information, Clue 2 is located at position (1,3). To reach Clue 2, I need to move horizontally or vertically without revisiting any cells.

There are four available moves: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), and (2,3).

EVALUATION:

* Move (1,2): This would put me closer to Clue 2 at position (1,3) by going down one row. However, this move could potentially limit my future options if I need to go left or right from the first row.
* Move (3,2): Moving up two rows and staying in the same column is not an efficient choice since it doesn't get me closer to Clue 2's location at (1,3).
* Move (2,1): This move would go left one column but only moves me away from Clue 2. It could also create a long path if I need to revisit the first row.
* Move (2,3): Going right one column doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2 at position (1,3).

DECISION:
Given that moving horizontally or vertically is required and revisiting cells must be avoided, the best move from my current position (2,2) towards visiting Clue 2 (located at (1,3)) would be to go down one row. This choice of going down doesn't limit potential future moves as much as moving left or right does.

* Move to (2,1): Moving down two rows would put me in the same column as clue 2, but I'd have to revisit cells and it's not the most efficient way to get there.
* Move to (1,0): This move would take me out of my current column and doesn't bring me any closer to clue 2.

DECISION:
Considering the above evaluation, moving left one cell is the best option as it gets me closer to clue 2 without revisiting cells or blocking future paths.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 11:48:07,597 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,0), which is marked on the visual board. I have filled 4/25 cells so far and my path taken so far is (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0). I need to visit clue 3 next, but its location is not specified in this step.

However, looking at the clues provided, Clue 2 is located at position (1,3), and since I'm ascending order, I should visit it next. From my current position (1,0), I can move up or left to reach clue 2. I have two available moves: (0,0) and (2,0).

EVALUATION:
For each available move, the pros and cons are as follows:

- Move (0,0):
  - Pros: Moves me closer to Clue 2.
  - Cons: Requires backtracking if I decide to go left from this position.

- Move (2,0):
  - Pros: Moves me diagonally towards the right but still within a row. It would take me away from potential future paths on my current row and does not block any possible future moves in that direction.
  - Cons: Not moving directly towards Clue 2 or any previously marked path.

DECISION:
Considering my need to visit clue 2 next, and the available options, moving (0,0) is slightly better as it positions me closer to Clue 2 without immediately blocking potential paths on either side of my current row. This move does require some backtracking if I don't reach Clue 2 directly from here.

STRATEGY:
I should start by visiting clue 1, which is the lowest numbered clue and must be visited first.

EVALUATION:

* Moving right to (1,0) also moves me towards clue 1, filling an empty cell along the way.

DECISION:
Both options are relatively neutral, with no significant advantages or disadvantages. However, since I need to visit all clues in ascending order and can't revisit a cell, I should start by moving up to (0,1), which will allow me to move towards clue 1 without blocking any future paths.

2025-12-10 11:48:26,258 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1), which means I'm in the first row and second column of the board. I have filled 6 out of 25 cells so far. Looking at the path taken so far, it appears that I started at clue number 2 and visited clues 3 and 4 in between before landing on my current position.

The visual board state shows that I'm surrounded by empty cells with no obstacles, which is good for navigation. However, I need to be mindful of visiting all clue numbers in ascending order and filling the necessary cells between them.

2. STRATEGY:
I should visit the next available clue number, which is Clue 3. However, we don't have its location yet since it's not provided. Since the last clue I visited was at position (1,2), I'll consider visiting the adjacent clues or the one below it to find Clue 3.

Given that Clue 2 was at (1,3) and the path has been going eastward so far, my next move should try to get closer to (1,3).

However, looking closely at the puzzle rules, I notice that we have an additional clue location provided: Clue 2 is indeed at position (1,3), but there's also a mention of Clue 1 being at position (2,2). Since we're currently ascending in our clue visits and haven't visited any clues beyond Clue 2 yet, I should actually visit the next available clue, which would be Clue 1.

Since Clue 1 is located at position (2,2), my current task is to get closer to that location. This means I can move northward from my current position (0,1).

3. EVALUATION:
From my current position (0,1), the available moves are indeed: (0,2). Since we have only one option here, there's no need for a comprehensive evaluation of pros and cons.

However, considering that I want to move northward towards Clue 1 at (2,2) and given the rules of the game, this single available move aligns perfectly with my goal.

4. DECISION:
Based on the above analysis and strategy, the most suitable next move is to go directly up from the current position.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (0,2), which means I have just filled the cell that was already filled on my previous path. My current situation is that I've filled 7 out of 25 cells, and I need to visit every clue in ascending order.

The next clue number I should visit is Clue 3, but it's not visible yet. However, we know that Clue 2 is located at position (1,3). Given my current location and the available clues, visiting Clue 2 is the next logical step.

Now let's evaluate each possible move from my current position:

* Move to (0,3): This would put me in the same row as Clue 2 but wouldn't be closer to it. It might also block future paths or create an unnecessary detour.
* Move to (1,2): While this gets me closer to Clue 2, it doesn't guarantee that I'll reach it sooner than if I go through other possible moves.

However, since the available next move is explicitly stated as (0,3), let's re-evaluate our strategy considering this constraint. Since we want to visit Clue 2 at (1,3) and we can only make a horizontal or vertical move from (0,2), moving to (0,3) gets us closer to the clue.

STRATEGY:
Since the goal is to fill all cells in one continuous path and visit all clues in ascending order, my next move should be towards clue 2.

EVALUATION:

**Available Move 1: (1,3)**
Pros: This move takes me directly to clue 2.
Cons: I might end up revisiting a cell or getting stuck if I'm not careful about the path back to higher-numbered clues.

Pros: This move keeps my options open for future moves and allows me to fill in empty cells along the way.
Cons: It doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 immediately, but it might be a necessary step if I need to backtrack later.

DECISION:
Given that visiting all clues in ascending order is crucial, I should prioritize reaching clue 2 as soon as possible.

Cons: I might end up revisiting a cell or getting stuck if I'm not careful about the path back to higher-numbered clues.

**Available Move 2: (0,4)**
Pros: This move keeps my options open for future moves and allows me to fill in empty cells along the way.
Cons: It doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 immediately, but it might be a necessary step if I need to backtrack later.

DECISION:
Given that visiting all clues in ascending order is crucial, I should prioritize reaching clue 2 as soon as possible. Moving directly to (1,3) would be the most efficient way to do this, even though it carries some risk of getting stuck. Considering my current position and the need for forward progress, moving directly to (1,3) seems like the best choice.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (1,3) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is not yet visible on the board. However, my current path order shows that I visited clue 2's position earlier, so it should be time for me to move to the correct location of clue 3.

According to the legend, I've already passed through (0,3) in my path order and now have a blank space between clues 1 and 2. So, the next clue number should indeed be at position (3,3), which is currently an empty cell. To reach this location from (1,3), I need to move one step down to fill that gap.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:
(2,3): Moving here will not help me in any way; it's just moving horizontally without contributing to my path.
(1,4): This move would take me away from the vertical path and potentially create a dead-end later on if I can't backtrack.

DECISION:
Considering that (0,3) is already passed through, I should fill in the blank space between clues 1 and 2 first. Then, from there, I'll be able to follow my ascending order of clue numbers properly.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,3) with a path of length 9 out of 25 cells filled. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, and my current position is one cell ahead of Clue 2. The next available clue is Clue 3.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is Clue 3. However, there's no direct information about the location of Clue 3. Since we're dealing with a 5x5 grid and I'm at (2,3), the possibilities for Clue 3 are limited. Given that I have to move in an ascending order, it's likely that Clue 3 is either above or diagonally left from my current position.

3. EVALUATION:
Available next moves:
- Move to (3,3): This would be a horizontal move, placing me directly above the current position. However, I'm not sure if there are any cells between us that need to be filled.
- Move to (2,4): This would place me diagonally to the right of my current position.

Pros and Cons for each available move:

Move to (3,3):
* Pros: Possible easier path towards Clue 3
* Cons: Limited information about cells between our positions

Move to (2,4):
* Pros: Diagonal moves are allowed, but they should be used judiciously as they may limit future options.
* Cons: May not lead directly towards Clue 3, given the constraints of the path.

4. DECISION:
Given that we need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and considering the limited information about cells between our positions, I'll opt for a move that gets me closer to a possible location of Clue 3 while keeping options open for future moves.

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (2,4), and according to the game state, I have filled 11 out of 25 cells. Looking at the visual board, I see that I've already visited clue numbers 3, 1, and 2 in ascending order.

**STRATEGY:** My next task is to visit the next higher clue number, which is clue number 4. However, according to the current path taken and game state, I haven't encountered any clues beyond 3 yet. I need to move in a direction that will allow me to access the higher numbered clues.

**EVALUATION:**

* Available Move (1,4): If I move up one row, I can fill an empty cell before reaching clue number 3 again. However, this won't directly lead me to any new or higher-numbered clues.
* Available Move (3,4): Moving down three rows and filling empty cells will eventually lead me away from my current position.

**DECISION:** Since both moves don't provide a direct path to clue number 4 or subsequent clues, I need to make a strategic decision. I have already visited clue number 2 at position (1,3), so visiting the next available clue should be my priority. Considering my goal is to visit all cells in ascending order, and there are no high-numbered clues close by, moving down three rows might seem like an option to access further regions of the board.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this move (3,4) would place me far away from any previously visited clue locations or my current path. Since visiting all cells exactly once is crucial, it's more efficient to stay within the vicinity of my previous clues and try to connect with existing paths.

**DECISION UPDATE:** Given these considerations, I will choose the move (1,4) over (3,4). Although this doesn't immediately help me find clue number 4 or any higher-numbered clues, it keeps me close to the path taken so far and allows for potential future connections.

2025-12-10 11:49:10,565 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position , and according to the game state, I have filled 11 out of 25 cells. Looking at the visual board, I see that I've already visited clue numbers 3, 1, and 2 in ascending order.

**STRATEGY:** My next task is to visit the next higher clue number, which is clue number 4. However, according to the current path taken and game state, I haven't encountered any clues beyond 3 yet. I need to move in a direction that will allow me to access the higher numbered clues.

**EVALUATION:**

* Available Move : If I move up one row, I can fill an empty cell before reaching clue number 3 again. However, this won't directly lead me to any new or higher-numbered clues.
* Available Move : Moving down three rows and filling empty cells will eventually lead me away from my current position.

**DECISION:** Since both moves don't provide a direct path to clue number 4 or subsequent clues, I need to make a strategic decision. I have already visited clue number 2 at position , so visiting the next available clue should be my priority. Considering my goal is to visit all cells in ascending order, and there are no high-numbered clues close by, moving down three rows might seem like an option to access further regions of the board.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this move  would place me far away from any previously visited clue locations or my current path. Since visiting all cells exactly once is crucial, it's more efficient to stay within the vicinity of my previous clues and try to connect with existing paths.

**DECISION UPDATE:** Given these considerations, I will choose the move  over . Although this doesn't immediately help me find clue number 4 or any higher-numbered clues, it keeps me close to the path taken so far and allows for potential future connections.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,4), which is a filled cell, and have completed a significant portion of the path so far. The current path taken is: (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4). I have already visited clue 1 at position (2,2), and the next clue to visit is clue 2 at position (1,3).

2. STRATEGY:
Since we need to follow the order of clues in ascending order, my next goal is to visit clue 2 at position (1,3). We have already passed through this cell before when moving from (0,3) to (1,3), but we didn't fill a clue there yet.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move:

- Move to (1,4):
    - Pros: This move gets me closer to the next set of empty cells that can potentially be part of my path.
    - Cons: Since I am at position (2,4) and need to visit clue 2 at (1,3), moving in this direction does not help achieve the immediate goal of reaching clue 2.

- Move to (3,4):
    - Pros: This move is away from my current path but doesn't block any future paths.
    - Cons: It doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 at (1,3) and requires filling additional empty cells which might not be necessary given the constraints of the puzzle.

Given these considerations, moving towards the area with fewer constraints seems like a better option. Since I'm trying to reach (1,3), the move that gets me closer to this point without unnecessary detours is preferable.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal to visit clue 2 at position (1,3) and evaluating the available moves, moving towards this direction by choosing one of the available next moves makes sense. However, it's crucial to select a move that does not block potential future paths or unnecessarily detour from the main objective.

MOVE: (3,4)

Note: This response aims to adhere closely to the step-by-step format requested while considering all given information and puzzle constraints.

I am currently at position (3,4), which is one of the corners of the board, and I have already filled 12 out of 25 cells. Looking at my path taken so far, I notice that I'm still following an irregular shape to get around the board. My current goal is to find a more efficient route to visit all remaining clues.

Strategy:
The next clue number I need to visit is not explicitly stated, but based on the ascending order rule (clue numbers 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest), it seems that I should aim for visiting Clue 10 or any subsequent high-numbered clue. However, we can only choose between two available moves: (4,4) and (3,3). Let's examine the locations of the clues to decide which one is more suitable.

Evaluation:
(1) Move to (4,4):
Pros: I'm trying to move towards higher-numbered clues.
Cons: This move takes me out of my current row and might not get me closer to the next clue in a straightforward manner. Also, it's possible that the path could become more complicated with this move.

(2) Move to (3,3):
Pros: This move gets me closer to the middle of the board, which might provide better opportunities for visiting higher-numbered clues.
Cons: However, I'm not sure if there are any high-numbered clues located near (3,3).

Decision:
Given that I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and considering my current position, moving to (3,3) seems like a more strategic choice. It gets me closer to the center of the board and might offer better opportunities for visiting higher-numbered clues.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 11:49:44,913 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

I am currently at position (3,4), having filled 12 out of 25 cells. My current path taken includes visiting Clue 1 and Clues 2-11 in ascending order. Looking ahead to the next clue numbers to visit, I see that the highest numbered clue left to visit is not yet determined because all clues have been visited up to this point. Therefore, my immediate goal is not necessarily to find a specific clue number but rather to create a path that allows me to continue visiting in ascending order.

However, since Clue 2 has already been visited and I need to maintain the continuous path with filled cells between clues as needed, the next clue I should aim to visit must be in ascending order. Given my current position (3,4), moving closer to a higher numbered clue makes sense because it increases the likelihood of being able to continue the path in ascending order.

Evaluating available moves: For each move at (4,4) and (3,3):

- Moving to (4,4):
  - Pros: It's in a corner position which might help guide the path towards the next clue.
  - Cons: This move does not seem directly beneficial for reaching a specific clue number because it is higher up on the board. However, my strategy should be to continue filling cells and maintain the path's continuity.

- Moving to (3,3):
  - Pros: It positions me closer to the middle of the board, which could potentially offer better movement options or help in aligning with future clues.
  - Cons: Like moving to (4,4), this doesn't seem directly beneficial for reaching a higher clue number but does contribute to filling the board.

Given that neither move seems optimal for reaching a specific clue due to their positions on the board and my current goal of visiting clues in ascending order, I need to think about which action will best allow me to continue moving upwards towards higher numbered clues while also ensuring I maintain a continuous path.

DECISION:
Since both moves have similar drawbacks but offer slightly different strategic advantages (moving to (3,3) might offer more flexibility in future paths while moving to (4,4) puts you into a corner position that could guide the path), considering my current goal of ascending order and filling cells as needed between clues, I should choose the move that best supports my immediate need to create space for future moves upwards. Given this scenario, moving to (3,3) seems more beneficial in terms of flexibility and allowing future movement towards higher clue numbers.

I am currently at position (3,3), which means I'm in the bottom-right part of the board. According to the Current Game State, my progress is 13/25 cells filled, indicating that there are still a significant number of empty cells to fill.

Analyzing the available clues, Clue 2 is located at position (1,3). Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, visiting Clue 2 next is a priority. The current position is relatively close to Clue 2, so moving towards it makes sense.

EVALUATION:

For each available move:
- **(4,3)**: This move would take me two cells up from my current position. It doesn't seem directly aligned with reaching Clue 2 at (1,3). However, it's worth considering because it could potentially open up a path to the top of the board.

- **(3,2)**: Moving one cell left brings me closer to both the center and the potential paths that lead towards Clue 2. Given the layout of the puzzle, moving horizontally seems more promising than moving vertically or diagonally.

DECISION:

Given the proximity to Clue 2 and considering the available moves, I think **(3,2)** is a better choice. It brings me closer to the clue and doesn't seem to block any future paths as strongly as moving up (4,3) could. This move seems to align well with my current situation and the strategy of visiting clues in ascending order.

I am currently at position (3,2), and I have filled 14 out of 25 cells in my path so far. My current goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order. The next unvisited clue number is 3, which is located at the top-right corner of the board at position (0,4).

STRATEGY:
My strategy should be to visit Clue 3 next, but first, I need to figure out how to get there without revisiting any cells or blocking future paths. Since I'm currently on the third row, I'll need to move down to the first row while keeping the path open.

EVALUATION:

* Available Move 1: (4,2)
	+ Pros: Moves me down towards the first row.
	+ Cons: Doesn't bring me closer to Clue 3 or the next unvisited clue number. The empty cells between clues might need more attention after this move.
* Available Move 2: (3,1)
	+ Pros: Gets me on the same row as Clue 4 and closer to the first column, which is good for future moves.
	+ Cons: Doesn't directly bring me towards Clue 3.

DECISION:
Given my current position and goal, I believe that Moving to (3,1) will give me a better chance of reaching Clue 3 efficiently. It gets me closer to the first column while keeping options open for future moves.

2025-12-10 11:50:01,854 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - I am currently at position (3,2), and I have filled 14 out of 25 cells in my path so far. My current goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order. The next unvisited clue number is 3, which is located at the top-right corner of the board at position (0,4).

STRATEGY:
My strategy should be to visit Clue 3 next, but first, I need to figure out how to get there without revisiting any cells or blocking future paths. Since I'm currently on the third row, I'll need to move down to the first row while keeping the path open.

EVALUATION:

* Available Move 1: (4,2)
	+ Pros: Moves me down towards the first row.
	+ Cons: Doesn't bring me closer to Clue 3 or the next unvisited clue number. The empty cells between clues might need more attention after this move.
* Available Move 2: (3,1)
	+ Pros: Gets me on the same row as Clue 4 and closer to the first column, which is good for future moves.
	+ Cons: Doesn't directly bring me towards Clue 3.

DECISION:
Given my current position and goal, I believe that Moving to (3,1) will give me a better chance of reaching Clue 3 efficiently. It gets me closer to the first column while keeping options open for future moves.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (3,1) and have filled 15 out of 25 cells. I need to visit clue 4 next, but it's not explicitly mentioned where it is located. However, looking at the available moves, I notice that they all point to either moving down or staying in the same column as my current position.

Clue 3 is already visited and clue 4 could be anywhere on the board, but given that we need to fill all cells in one continuous path, visiting clue 4 next means it must be located somewhere that allows me to reach other unvisited clues.

The available moves are: (2,1), (4,1), and (3,0).

Let's evaluate each option:

- Move to (2,1): This move would put me below my current position and allow me to visit clue 4 if it exists there or somewhere nearby.
- Move to (4,1): This move would put me at the bottom row and may not provide an easy way to reach other clues. However, I could still potentially fill in some of the cells on this row.

Considering these options and the need to keep my path continuous and connected, visiting clue 3 was part of filling a necessary gap between clue numbers. Now we must find a suitable location for our next move that will get us closer to reaching all remaining clues.

However, given the current state of the board, I can see a more promising strategy by considering what clue number comes after the one already visited, and finding an optimal path to reach it.


EVALUATION:
Since we don't know where clue 4 is located, but need to move forward, our next task should be to find the correct sequence of moves that will enable us to visit the remaining clues in ascending order.

Considering this, I think moving to (2,1) would provide a possible path forward by potentially reaching the row below me and allowing for more flexibility in my future moves.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number should be 3 since it is the highest one that hasn't been visited yet.


DECISION:
Considering all factors above and with no additional information about clue locations, moving to (2,1) seems like a good move as it allows potential progress towards reaching all clues.

I am currently at position (3,1), which is indicated by [15] on the board. I've already filled 15 out of 25 cells and my current path is quite long. I need to visit clue 4 next, but it's not explicitly mentioned where clue 4 is located. However, considering the previous moves, we can deduce that the clue numbers are usually at a distance from each other. Since the last visited clue was [11] at position (3,4), and my current position is also on the same column, I should visit a clue further down.

Looking at the available next moves, which are (2,1), (4,1), or (3,0), I think visiting clue 4 would be beneficial. Clue 4 is likely located at the bottom of the board, considering my previous path and the filled cells.

STRATEGY:
The highest numbered clue I can visit next is indeed [12] at position (3,2) doesn't seem to be it, as it's not in the available moves list, or maybe it was already visited and I missed that. It seems more likely that Clue 4 is located at a lower row.

EVALUATION:
Available next move (1) [(2,1)]:
- Pros: Visiting a new clue would be beneficial.
- Cons: Moving to (2,1) might not get me closer to the final path.

Available next move (2) [(4,1)]:
- Pros: This position seems likely for Clue 4 or an empty cell that will help me reach it in the future.
- Cons: It's a longer horizontal move than I'd like at this point.

Available next move (3) [(3,0)]:
- Pros: It gets me closer to the bottom of the board, potentially helping with my next moves.
- Cons: However, this move is not as efficient for visiting Clue 4 or another clue, if that's where it is.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis and strategy, I think moving down one row would be beneficial. Although (2,1) seems like a clue location, the current board state and available moves suggest visiting an empty cell at the bottom of the board might help with future path construction.

- Pros: This position seems likely for Clue 4 or an empty cell that will help me reach it in the future.
- Cons: It's a longer horizontal move than I'd like at this point.

Available next move (3) [(3,0)]:
- Pros: It gets me closer to the bottom of the board, potentially helping with my next moves.
- Cons: However, this move is not as efficient for visiting Clue 4 or another clue, if that's where it is.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis and strategy, I think moving down one row would be beneficial. Although (2,1) seems like a clue location, the current board state and available moves suggest visiting an empty cell at the bottom of the board might help with future path construction.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (4,1), having filled 16 out of 25 cells in my path. I have already visited clues 1 and 2, so my next goal is to visit clue 3, which is located at position (3,0). The available moves are (4,0) and (4,2).

STRATEGY:
Since I need to visit clue 3, my primary focus is on reaching it. Clue 3 is at the top-left corner of the board, so I should aim for that area.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (4,0): This move takes me directly towards clue 3's location. If I go to (4,0), I'll be one step closer to clue 3 and can continue from there.
	+ Pros: Directly approaches clue 3
	+ Cons: Might limit future options if not careful with path construction

* (4,2): This move takes me diagonally down-right but doesn't directly approach clue 3. It seems less efficient for reaching clue 3.

DECISION:
Given the analysis above, I choose to move (4,0) because it directly approaches clue 3's location, and from there, I can continue building my path towards other clues.

I am currently at position (4,0), having completed a path that started at clue 1 (2,2) and visited several cells in ascending order. As per the game state, I have filled 17 out of 25 cells. The current goal is to end my path at the highest numbered clue.

Looking ahead, I need to visit the next available clue, which is clue number 3. However, it's not directly adjacent to my current position (4,0). After some analysis, I realize that I can't visit clue 2 again because it's already been visited. The logical step would be to find a path that includes a sequence of cells leading me towards the next available clue.

I can move from my current position (4,0) to various adjacent cells: (3,0), (5,0), or go back in the reverse order. Given the available options and considering the board structure, I need to find a path that sets me up for visiting clue 3.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit is indeed Clue 3. From my research, Clue 3's location is at (4,2), but unfortunately, we are not directly allowed to see this information yet; instead, the clue locations are hidden in the board.

EVALUATION FOR EACH MOVE:

- **Move (3,0)**: This would take me towards the top row of the board. However, considering my current goal of visiting Clue 3 (but we don't know where it is), and having already filled many cells near this path, moving to (3,0) might not be the most efficient way forward.

- **Other moves**: The problem does not explicitly allow for backward movements beyond the immediate past position. Thus, considering my current situation, moving forward or staying within a reasonable distance from my path seems like the best strategy.

DECISION:
Given that I have to visit clue 3 next and I'm at (4,0), I need to figure out where Clue 3 is located. Although I can't see the location directly yet, visiting it implies moving towards the top row, considering our standard puzzle-solving behavior. The most efficient move for me, given my current progress and the structure of the board, would be to move up one row but also consider a path that could potentially lead to Clue 3 efficiently.

I am currently at position (3,0) and have filled 18 out of 25 cells according to the game state. My path has already visited many positions, including the clues 1 at (2,2) and 2 at (1,3). I need to continue visiting the remaining clue numbers in ascending order.

Looking at the current board state, I notice that there are several empty cells between the filled ones, which means I can move horizontally or vertically without revisiting a cell. The available next moves according to the problem statement are both horizontal and vertical options from my current position (3,0), but only one option is given: moving to position (2,0).

From this position, my next goal is to visit clue 3 at an unknown location. However, based on the clue locations provided earlier, I can assume that the remaining clues will be located in a similar pattern or close to each other.

EVALUATION:
The available move (2,0) takes me closer to the middle of the board and potentially reduces the number of empty cells between clues. This might make it easier to find and visit future clue locations.

Considering the pros:

* Moving to (2,0) brings me closer to the center of the board.
* It doesn't block any potential paths or require backtracking if I need to move in a different direction later.

The cons are minimal since we have not yet determined which clue number should be visited next.

DECISION:
Given that my current position is (3,0), moving to (2,0) seems like the most logical and straightforward choice. This will allow me to re-evaluate my path and potentially plan the next steps more efficiently.

2025-12-10 11:50:54,766 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - I am currently at position (3,0) and have filled 18 out of 25 cells according to the game state. My path has already visited many positions, including the clues 1 at (2,2) and 2 at (1,3). I need to continue visiting the remaining clue numbers in ascending order.

Looking at the current board state, I notice that there are several empty cells between the filled ones, which means I can move horizontally or vertically without revisiting a cell. The available next moves according to the problem statement are both horizontal and vertical options from my current position (3,0), but only one option is given: moving to position (2,0).

From this position, my next goal is to visit clue 3 at an unknown location. However, based on the clue locations provided earlier, I can assume that the remaining clues will be located in a similar pattern or close to each other.

EVALUATION:
The available move (2,0) takes me closer to the middle of the board and potentially reduces the number of empty cells between clues. This might make it easier to find and visit future clue locations.

Considering the pros:

* Moving to (2,0) brings me closer to the center of the board.
* It doesn't block any potential paths or require backtracking if I need to move in a different direction later.

The cons are minimal since we have not yet determined which clue number should be visited next.

DECISION:
Given that my current position is (3,0), moving to (2,0) seems like the most logical and straightforward choice. This will allow me to re-evaluate my path and potentially plan the next steps more efficiently.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Looking at the board state, I see that there are some empty cells in between my current path and clue 2, which is located at position (1,3).

STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit clue 2, as it's in ascending order from the previous clue. Clue 2 is located at position (1,3), so I need to find a way to get there.

EVALUATION:
My available next moves are: (2,1). However, since (2,1) is not an option for me to move directly towards clue 2 from my current position, I will consider it as the only possible move in this step. Let's evaluate its pros and cons:

Pros of moving to (2,1): This move allows me to get closer to the empty cell between clues 3 and 4.

Cons of moving to (2,1): It doesn't bring me any closer to clue 2.

DECISION:
Considering that I can only move one step at a time and my goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, moving to (2,1) is the best option for now. This will allow me to get ready for my next move towards clue 2.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 20 out of 25 cells. My current path is (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1). My next task is to figure out where I should go from here. Looking at the clue locations, Clue 1 is already visited, and Clue 2 is located at position (1,3).

STRATEGY:
Since I have already visited Clue 1 at position (2,2), my next goal is to visit Clue 2 at position (1,3). However, since I am already at a nearby location (2,1) and need to fill more empty cells before reaching the end of the board.

EVALUATION:
From my current position (2,1), the available moves are:

* Move up: (2,0)
	+ Pros: gets me closer to Clue 2 and opens up space for future moves
	+ Cons: might not be the most efficient path to Clue 2
* Move down: (3,1)
	+ Pros: keeps me in a relatively central location on the board
	+ Cons: doesn't get me any closer to Clue 2
* Move left: (1,1)
	+ Pros: gets me closer to Clue 2 and opens up space for future moves
	+ Cons: blocks some potential paths if I need to move back

DECISION:
Considering my goal of visiting Clue 2 at position (1,3), moving up to (2,0) is a good choice. This move gets me closer to Clue 2 and opens up space for future moves.

Analysis:
I am currently at position (2,1), and my path has taken a turn to fill cells in a seemingly random order. According to the progress, 20 out of 25 cells are filled, which means I've made significant progress on this puzzle. The current position is adjacent to Clue 1 at (2,2), but we need to move further.

Strategy:
The next clue number should be visited in ascending order, so I must head towards Clue 3. However, looking at the board, there's no direct path from my current location (2,1) to Clue 3's potential locations. Therefore, our primary goal is to get closer to Clue 3 while ensuring we don't revisit any cells and that our next move fills an empty cell.

Evaluation:
From my current position at (2,1), the available moves are:

* Moving down to (3,1) would require us to fill a cell between us and our destination. This doesn't seem ideal since it could limit future paths.
* Moving right to (2,2) is not an option because we've already been there in the path history.
* We can move up to (1,1), but this might not be the best choice as it doesn't bring us closer to Clue 3 directly and might create more obstacles later on.

However, after re-examining my previous moves and the current state of the board, I realized that moving right from (2,1) to (2,3) and then down to (3,3), or even trying a move up to (2,0), could be beneficial. But considering we are looking for Clue 3, which must be located after (2,2) on the board, these moves do not bring us closer to that destination.

But moving right from (2,1) is our next optimal choice since it sets up a path for future moves and does not create an obstacle in our way.

Decision:
The best move seems to be moving right from my current position at (2,1), but this would take me towards Clue 2's location rather than directly progressing towards Clue 3.
