2025-11-23 20:00:39,338 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

            === PUZZLE RULES ===
            1. Fill ALL 16 cells in one continuous path
            2. Start at clue number 1
            3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
            4. End your path at the highest numbered clue and you must have visited all cells by then
            5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
            6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
            7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

            === BOARD INFORMATION ===
            Board Size: 4x4
            Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

            Coordinate Grid:
            (0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)  (0,3)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)  (1,3)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)  (2,3)
(3,0)  (3,1)  (3,2)  (3,3)

            Clue 1: position (2,2)
Clue 2: position (1,3)

            === CURRENT GAME STATE ===
            Progress: 1/16 cells filled
            Current Position: (2,2)
            Path Taken: (2,2)

            Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

            === YOUR TASK ===
            Available Next Moves: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3)

            Think step by step:
            1. Where are you now?
            2. What clue number should you visit next?
            3. What empty cells can you move to that get you closer to the next clue?
            4. Which move keeps your path connected and valid?

            RESPOND WITH ONLY: (row,col)
            Example: (1,2)
