MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (4,2), which is Clue 1, and I have filled 1 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit Clue 2 next, which is located at position (1,0). From my current position, I have three available moves: (3,2), (4,1), or (4,3).

STRATEGY:
Since I am starting with a high clue number and need to visit all clues in ascending order, the logical next step would be to move to Clue 2.

EVALUATION:

- **Move (3,2)**: This option is not ideal because it doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2. It's more of a lateral move and doesn't seem to offer any immediate advantage in getting me to the next clue.

- **Move (4,1)**: Moving horizontally from my current position would indeed bring me closer to the second clue, which is at (1,0). This option seems promising as it's directly moving towards Clue 2.

- **Move (4,3)**: Similar to moving to (3,2), this move doesn't seem as beneficial since it doesn't reduce the distance to Clue 2. It might even create an unnecessary detour if I don't have a reason to move in that direction immediately.

DECISION:
Given the options, moving horizontally towards the second clue at position (1,0) makes the most sense. This is because it directly reduces the distance between my current location and Clue 2 without creating unnecessary paths or blocking future moves.

2025-12-10 12:54:40,693 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,1), which is located between clues 1 and 4 in the top-right part of the board. The path taken so far is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1). Looking at the available moves, I need to decide where to go next to reach the remaining clues.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number should be clue 5 or higher. Clue 5 is located at position (1,4), which means I will need to move left from my current position or continue upwards.

EVALUATION:

Available Move 1: (2,1)
Pros: Moves me up and closer to the top-left part of the board.
Cons: Doesn't directly take me towards clue 5, but gets me out of the way for future possibilities.

Available Move 2: (3,0)
Pros: Moves me left and down simultaneously, which could be useful in reaching the bottom-right part of the board.
Cons: May limit my options if I need to revisit this area or move back up quickly.

Available Move 3: (3,2)
Pros: Moves me right, which keeps the current path somewhat linear. However, it doesn't directly help with visiting clue 5 yet.
Cons: This might create a longer path in the future and could block potential moves if I need to backtrack.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis, I believe that moving left (down) would be beneficial for now since it keeps options open for reaching both clue 4 and potentially moving down towards clue 6. However, considering the overall strategy of heading upwards towards clue 5, (3,0) seems like a more direct move compared to (2,1), which just moves up without making significant progress.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (3,0) and have filled 4 out of 25 cells. The current path taken is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0). My goal is to visit clue numbers in ascending order. So far, I've visited clues 1, 3, and 4.

STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit Clue 5, which is located at position (1,4).

EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

* Move to (2,0): This would bring me closer to clue 5, but it's not directly adjacent. It might be a good option if there were no other moves that get me closer or more convenient.
* Move to (4,0): I'd be going down instead of trying to move towards the east direction where Clue 5 is located.

DECISION: Considering the position and distance from Clue 5 at (1,4), moving to (2,0) seems like a better initial choice because it's slightly closer than moving straight down. It also opens up more potential paths for future moves compared to going directly south.

I am currently at position (2,0), which is one of my available next moves according to the game state. I have filled 5 out of 25 cells so far. The current path taken is from Clue 1 (4,2) through a series of empty cells. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 3, which is located at position (0,1). To get there from my current position, I can move either horizontally or vertically.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

- Moving to (2,1): This would take me diagonally and doesn't align with the required horizontal or vertical moves.
- Moving to (2,3) is not an option as it's outside my available next moves.

Among the two valid options given by the game state:
- (1,0)
- (2,1)

EVALUATION OF EACH OPTION:
Moving to (1,0):
Pros: It gets me closer to Clue 3 at position (0,1).
Cons: This move doesn't allow for an immediate continuation on the path from Clue 3 to other clue locations.

Moving to (2,1):
Pros: It's closer to my current position and allows a more direct approach towards Clue 4.
Cons: This move doesn't align with visiting Clue 3 first.

DECISION:
Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and my next required step is to visit Clue 3, moving to (1,0) seems like the best option as it gets me closer to Clue 3. Although this path might not be the most direct at present, visiting Clue 3 first sets up the correct progression for the rest of the puzzle.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (1,0), which is the second clue I need to visit in ascending order. My current path is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0). There are 25 cells on the board, and I've filled 6 out of them so far.

STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is Clue 7. However, since Clue 5 and Clue 6 have already been placed on the board, I must assume that the next clue will be at a higher position. To determine which clue to visit next, I will evaluate the possible locations of Clue 7.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

1. Move to (0,0): This would take me away from any potential path to Clue 7 and might leave limited options for future moves.
2. Move to (1,1): From here, I could potentially access the upper-left part of the board and get closer to Clue 3 or other clues.

DECISION:
Considering the need to visit higher-clued locations, moving to (1,1) seems like a more strategic choice. It allows me to explore the upper-left area of the board, where potential clue locations might be available.

STRATEGY:
My next clue to visit is indeed Clue 3, and it's situated at position (0,1). To reach this location, I need to move either horizontally or vertically.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (0,0) or (1,1). Let's evaluate each option:

- Move to (0,0): This would take me out of the way and create a longer path in the future. If I go this route, I'll need to revisit some cells to get back on track.
- Move to (1,1): This gets me one step closer to Clue 3 without creating any unnecessary detours.

DECISION:
Considering my current position and the goal of reaching Clue 3 efficiently, moving to (1,1) is the optimal choice. It allows me to stay focused on the correct path and visit subsequent clues in ascending order.

Considering my next move, the highest numbered clue left to visit is Clue 6 at position (1,3). However, since the path needs to be continuous and include all clues in ascending order, visiting Clue 5 (position (1,4)) would be more optimal before reaching Clue 6. Therefore, my next goal is to move towards Clue 5.

EVALUATION:
- Available moves: (0,1), (2,1), or (1,2).
- Pros and cons for each move:
  - (0,1): This move does not bring me closer to any clue. It would be a detour from the optimal path.
  - (2,1): Moving in this direction would get me closer to Clue 5 but doesn't align with my strategy of visiting clues in ascending order for now.
  - (1,2): This move is directly towards Clue 5 at position (1,4), which is the next clue I need to visit. It also fills an empty cell needed between the current and future paths.

DECISION:
Given that visiting Clues 3 and 4 are not required to be done in ascending order before reaching Clue 6 and considering my strategy of optimizing my path by moving towards the next required clue (Clue 5), the best move is to go directly to Clue 5 at position (1,4).

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 12:55:33,964 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have already visited clue 1. The next clue I need to visit in ascending order is clue 2, which is located at position (1,0). My current path has me moving horizontally and vertically without revisiting any cells, so I don't have any restrictions on my movement.

STRATEGY:
Since the goal is to visit every cell exactly once and fill all clues in ascending order, my next step should be to reach clue 2. I already know its position at (1,0), which is adjacent to my current location. This will help me stay on track with visiting all clues in sequence.

EVALUATION:
Available moves are: (0,2), (2,2), and (1,3).

- Moving to (0,2) would bring me closer to the top of the board but not directly towards clue 2. This could be a good move if I wanted to explore other areas first.
- Moving to (2,2) takes me away from the path to clue 2 and might require backtracking later on.
- Moving to (1,3) puts me out of order because it skips clue 2.

DECISION:
The best move is to go directly to clue 2 at position (1,0). This keeps the puzzle progression linear and follows the ascending order of clues. It also allows for the most straightforward path forward.

I am currently at position (1,2), and my current situation is that I need to visit all the remaining clues in ascending order after visiting clue 6, which is located at (1,3). My goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path.

STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit clue 7, but since it's not provided in the available moves, I will consider visiting the next closest clue. Clue 8 is also not present among the options, so I will focus on moving towards the lower-right part of the board to get closer to clue 5 and clue 6.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (0,2): This move takes me two rows up but doesn't bring me any closer to clue 5 or clue 6. It might help me avoid revisiting cells in the top-left part of the board.
* (2,2): Moving down one row and staying in the same column could help me get closer to clue 4 and might also open up possibilities for future moves.
* (1,3): This move takes me directly towards clue 6 but would block any potential path that requires visiting cells between my current position and clue 5.

DECISION:
Considering the options, moving down one row and staying in the same column at (2,2) seems like a good choice because it brings me closer to clue 4 and doesn't block any paths. However, since clue 6 is located at (1,3), visiting that clue would be more efficient if I could make my way there safely.

Considering the pros and cons of each move, I choose the middle option:

I am currently at position (2,2), which is where Clue 4 is located, and I have filled 9 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end my path at the highest numbered clue, which is Clue 6.

Next, I need to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (0,1). From my current position, I have three available moves: (3,2), (2,1), or (2,3).

STRATEGY:
I should visit the next clue in ascending order. Since Clue 4 is already visited and we are moving to Clue 3.

EVALUATION:

* Move (3,2): This move would get me closer to the top of the board but does not bring me any closer to visiting Clue 3.
* Move (2,1): This move gets me directly adjacent to Clue 3 and moves me down the left column. However, it also puts us one step away from potentially going over the path of clue 4 which is in a similar spot.
* Move (2,3): This move would take us towards the top-right corner but doesn't bring us closer to visiting Clue 3.

DECISION:
Based on my evaluation of each available move and considering the goal of visiting all clues in ascending order, I should choose the move that gets me directly adjacent to Clue 3 and moves me down the left column.

2025-12-10 12:55:52,347 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - I am currently at position (2,2), which is where Clue 4 is located, and I have filled 9 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end my path at the highest numbered clue, which is Clue 6.

Next, I need to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (0,1). From my current position, I have three available moves: (3,2), (2,1), or (2,3).

STRATEGY:
I should visit the next clue in ascending order. Since Clue 4 is already visited and we are moving to Clue 3.

EVALUATION:

* Move (3,2): This move would get me closer to the top of the board but does not bring me any closer to visiting Clue 3.
* Move (2,1): This move gets me directly adjacent to Clue 3 and moves me down the left column. However, it also puts us one step away from potentially going over the path of clue 4 which is in a similar spot.
* Move (2,3): This move would take us towards the top-right corner but doesn't bring us closer to visiting Clue 3.

DECISION:
Based on my evaluation of each available move and considering the goal of visiting all clues in ascending order, I should choose the move that gets me directly adjacent to Clue 3 and moves me down the left column.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 12:56:06,575 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

I am currently at position (2,1), and I've filled 10 out of 25 cells. The current path is: (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1). My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and fill the remaining cells.

I have two main tasks: visiting the next clue number and navigating through the board to connect all clues. The closest unvisited clue to me is Clue 5 at position (1,4), but since it's not connected yet, I need to find a path that leads me there or consider other options.

Strategy:
Considering my current position, the available moves, and the goal of visiting the next clue number in ascending order, my next task is to decide which direction to take from (2,1). Since Clue 5 is at (1,4), I need to move towards it but also keep an eye on connecting with other clues.

Evaluation:
From (2,1), available moves include:

* Moving down: (3,1) or (4,1)
* Moving left: (2,0)
* Moving up: (1,1) or (0,1)

Pros and Cons of each move:

- **(3,1)**: This move gets me closer to Clue 5 at (1,4), but it might block potential paths if I need to backtrack.
- **(4,1)**: Similar to the previous option; this move takes me further away from some clues and doesn't seem optimal for connecting other clues directly.
- **(2,0)**: Moving left gets me closer to Clue 3 at (0,1), which could be useful but might not lead directly to Clue 5.
- **(1,1)**: This move is a viable option as it gets me to the first row without blocking potential paths and keeps me relatively central on the board. However, it doesn't directly contribute to reaching Clue 5.

Decision:
Given my analysis, moving up to (1,1) seems like the most reasonable choice at this point because it:

1. Keeps me in a central location.
2. Doesn’t block any potential future paths.
3. Prepares me for connecting other clues more efficiently.
4. Sets the stage for potentially reaching Clue 5 through additional moves.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,1), and I have filled 10 out of 25 cells. I need to continue my path in ascending order and visit all clue numbers from 4 onwards. My current situation is that I'm stuck with no available next moves. However, looking closer at the board, I realize that I can try to find a way to move further by exploring adjacent empty cells.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 5, which is located at position (1,4). From my current position, this seems like an attractive option because it moves me towards the top right corner of the board and gets me closer to the higher-numbered clues. However, before heading directly to Clue 5, I should consider whether there are any intermediate clues or paths that would be more beneficial.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move from my current position (2,1), I can consider the following options:

* Move up: This gets me closer to the top row but doesn't immediately take me towards Clue 5.
* Move right: This is a potential way to get closer to Clue 5, but it might also block future paths or create difficulties in reaching other clues.
* Other moves: Since I'm at position (2,1), any move that's not up or right would likely take me away from the path and towards previously visited cells.

EVALUATION PROS AND CONS:

* Up: (+) gets closer to top row; (-) doesn't immediately help with Clue 5
* Right: (+) moves closer to Clue 5; (-) might block future paths or create difficulties

4. DECISION:
Based on the evaluation, moving right seems like a more promising option because it takes me closer to Clue 5. However, I need to carefully consider whether this move would indeed be beneficial in the long run.

DECISION REASONING:
I will choose to move right from position (2,1) towards position (2,2), which is currently blocked by a clue number "9". Since moving right is the only viable option that doesn't take me away from the path, I'll proceed with this move. This might allow me to make progress and find an optimal route to reach Clue 5 and subsequent clues.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,1) with a filled path of 10/25 cells. I need to visit the next higher numbered clue after Clue 6. The highest remaining clue not visited yet is Clue 7, but its location isn't specified in the current state. However, there's no available move from the given options, indicating that my current position might be blocked or limited.

Given this situation, I should consider moving towards the next potential clue based on the board layout and path history. The clues already visited are Clue 1 (4,2), Clue 2 (1,0), Clue 3 (0,1), and Clue 6 is at (1,3). Since Clue 7's location isn't specified but its visitation order follows the current state, I'll aim for moving towards the area of the board where it could logically be placed considering the path history.

Since there are no available moves explicitly listed, I have to deduce a potential next move based on logic. Considering my path so far and looking at the empty spaces around Clue 6 (1,3), if I aim for an adjacent cell towards the lower-left direction from Clue 6 or try to extend in a way that keeps options open for later moves, it makes sense to attempt moving into the available space next to where the path could potentially unfold further.

Based on this analysis and strategy, my potential move would be to:

I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled only 1 out of 25 cells. I need to visit all clues in ascending order, starting with clue 2, which is located at position (4,2). From my current position, the available next moves are: (1,2), (0,1), or (0,3).

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue 2. Since it's already at a higher y-coordinate than my current position, I need to move down and then left or right to reach it.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* **Move (1,2)**: Pros: Moves me one row down. Cons: Still not closer to clue 2.
* **Move (0,1)**: Pros: Moves me one column to the left. Cons: Doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 or other clues in ascending order.
* **Move (0,3)**: Pros: Moves me one column to the right. Cons: Also doesn't bring me closer to clue 2.

DECISION:
Since moving down is a necessary step towards reaching clue 2, I will choose the move that gets me closer to it while also considering future paths. The optimal choice would be to move (1,2), which brings me one row down and opens up possibilities for further movement.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled only 1 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in a continuous path.
2. STRATEGY: The next clue to visit is number 2, which is located at position (4,2). However, before visiting the highest numbered clue directly, we need to ensure that all other clues are visited in ascending order and filled in between them with empty cells as needed.
3. EVALUATION:

   - **Move to (1,2)**: This would put me next to Clue 2 but doesn't allow me to reach it immediately since I have to follow the ascending order of clue numbers.

   - **Move to (0,1)**: Moving horizontally to the left would not bring me closer to any higher-numbered clues and could potentially isolate Clue 3, which is next in the order.

   - **Move to (0,3)**: Similar to moving to the left, this move doesn't bring us closer to our immediate objective of visiting clue numbers in ascending order. It's also away from a potential path that could lead directly to higher-numbered clues after Clue 2 is visited.

4. DECISION:
Considering my current position and the need to visit all clues in ascending order, moving to (0,1) seems like the best initial move. This allows us to progress horizontally towards the clue locations while keeping an eye on maintaining a path that adheres to the rules of visiting all cells exactly once.

2025-12-10 12:56:56,703 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1), and I have already filled 2 out of 25 cells. My path so far is (0,2) -> (0,1). According to the puzzle rules, I need to visit every clue number in ascending order. The current clue numbers I've visited are 1 (at position (0,2)).

2. STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit Clue 2, which is located at position (4,2). However, since I can only move horizontally or vertically and need to fill empty cells between clues as needed, I may not necessarily start moving directly towards (4,2) right away. My priority is still to explore the surrounding area and find the most efficient path.

3. EVALUATION:
Available next moves are (1,1) and (0,0). For each move:

- (1,1): This move gets me closer to Clue 3 at position (1,1), which I need to visit eventually as part of my ascending order requirement. It also opens up new pathways to explore towards the bottom-right corner where Clue 2 is located.

- (0,0): Moving here doesn't immediately progress any clue numbers but could potentially allow me more flexibility in moving vertically towards Clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Considering my need to visit all clues in ascending order and knowing that I have already visited Clue 1 at position (0,2), the next logical step is to move towards the area of Clue 3 while also keeping options open for future paths. Between (0,0) and (1,1), moving to (1,1) gets me closer to a clue in ascending order and sets up more efficient paths forward.

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (1,1), which means I have visited Clue 3 as per the path taken: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1). My current situation is that I need to continue visiting clue numbers in ascending order. Since I've already visited Clue 3, my next target should be Clue 4.

**STRATEGY:** The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 4. However, there's no direct mention of its location in the provided information. Given that the clues are located at specific positions and we have to fill all cells between them, I will assume that the correct sequence should lead me towards higher-numbered clues. Therefore, my next target should be Clue 4.

**EVALUATION:**

- **Available Move (2,1):** Moving up would put me in a position closer to potentially being able to reach the upper part of the board more efficiently but does not directly address visiting Clue 4.

- **Available Move (1,0):** Moving left does not help with reaching any higher-numbered clue directly and would essentially back me into an area where I'd have to navigate around a potential path for future clues.

- **Available Move (1,2):** This move is actually not listed among the available choices but considering my need to visit Clue 4 next, moving right could potentially allow for easier navigation towards higher-numbered clues or at least give me room to explore. However, I must choose from the options provided which do not include this.

Considering the given moves and aiming to reach the highest possible clue position efficiently:

**DECISION:** The best move among the available choices is (1,0), as it allows for more exploration space and doesn't force a specific path that might lead away from higher-numbered clues. However, ideally, I would prefer to move towards a direction or position that's likely to lead me closer to Clue 4, but between the given options, moving left is the safer choice to explore and possibly backtrack if needed.

- **Available Move (1,0):** Moving left does not help with reaching any higher-numbered clue directly and would essentially back me into an area where I'd have to navigate around a potential path for future clues.

- **Available Move (1,2):** This move is actually not listed among the available choices but considering my need to visit Clue 4 next, moving right could potentially allow for easier navigation towards higher-numbered clues or at least give me room to explore. However, I must choose from the options provided which do not include this.

Considering the given moves and aiming to reach the highest possible clue position efficiently:

**DECISION:** The best move among the available choices is (1,0), as it allows for more exploration space and doesn't force a specific path that might lead away from higher-numbered clues. However, ideally, I would prefer to move towards a direction or position that's likely to lead me closer to Clue 4, but between the given options, moving left is the safer choice to explore and possibly backtrack if needed.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (1,0), which means I'm in the second row and first column of the grid. The path taken so far is (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0). This indicates that I've visited clue 3 already.

Looking at the current game state, I have a few available moves: (0,0) and (2,0). Since my goal is to visit all clues in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue, which is clue 5, I need to plan my next move carefully.

Next, I should aim to visit clue 4, which is located at position (3,1) or somewhere near it. However, since the available moves are limited to (0,0) and (2,0), I'll evaluate each option separately.

EVALUATION:
- **Move to (0,0)**: This would be a backward move, taking me away from the current path. It might block some potential paths or create a dead-end if I don't visit clue 4 soon.

- **Move to (2,0)**: This option seems more promising as it allows me to potentially find a direct route to clue 4.

STRATEGY:
Since I'm currently at position (1,0) and need to visit all clues in ascending order, the next clue after 3 would be clue 4. Clue 4's location is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the legend of the puzzle, we know that a path will lead to it.

DECISION:
Given these considerations, I think moving to (2,0) is the best option for now. It allows me to potentially move forward and find a direct route to clue 4 without blocking any future paths.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,0), which means I'm on the third row and first column of the board. According to the path taken so far, I have visited clues 1 and 3 in ascending order. Now, my current position is two cells away from clue 3.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number to visit is indeed clue 4. However, since it's not directly adjacent to me, I need to plan my path accordingly. Clue 4 is located at position (3,1), but there are no other clues in the first column of the third row that we should prioritize.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
   a) Move to (3,0): This would take me horizontally one cell away from my current position. However, it doesn't get me any closer to clue 4 or provide an advantage over moving vertically.

   b) Move to (2,1): This move gets me diagonally but also moves me in the right direction towards clues higher up in value, although it's not a direct path towards clue 4.

4. DECISION: Considering my current position and available moves, neither of them seems directly advantageous for visiting clue 4 immediately. Given that I'm on the third row and want to maintain an ascending order, I should aim to get closer to the higher-numbered clues first. Moving up is generally a better option since it allows me more flexibility for future paths. Thus, moving to (2,1) seems like the best choice because it maintains my vertical momentum without blocking any potential paths.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,1), and my path has been: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1). There are 6 filled cells out of a total of 25.

2. STRATEGY: My next goal is to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (1,1), where I am currently sitting! However, since I've already visited this clue, my next target should be the highest numbered clue that hasn't been visited yet, which is either not among the options or I need to follow the ascending order. Since we're in a 5x5 grid and following the ascending order of clues (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...), Clue 4 at position (3,0) comes next.

However, considering the given available next moves are (3,1) and (2,2), it seems I should prioritize visiting the next clue after (1,1). Since we're on a grid with ascending order, let's check if there is any other clue that hasn't been mentioned yet: Clue 2 at position (4,2) has been visited but not in sequence; hence, let's look for the highest unvisited one. Given the rules and my current situation, I should proceed to visit Clues following the ascending order after visiting (1,1).

3. EVALUATION:
- Option 1: Move to (2,2)
  - Pros: Allows me to move horizontally or vertically from here.
  - Cons: Doesn't get closer to any clue directly; might not fit well with the ascending clue visitation sequence.

- Option 2: Move to (3,1)
  - Pros: Gets me slightly closer to Clue 4 but doesn't align perfectly with the clues' ascending order we must follow.
  - Cons: The move to (3,1) would be out of sequence for visiting the highest clue first if not done strategically.

- Considering my immediate next goal is following the ascending order and since I'm at a position where the next logical step could lead me towards Clue 4 or continuing the ascending order by not deviating too much from it.

4. DECISION:
Given that we are in a path-finding puzzle with an emphasis on visiting each clue in ascending order, the best move seems to be (3,1) as it aligns slightly better with the sequence when considering my next immediate goal after (1,1). It also doesn't block any direct paths but is more about following the sequence than being directly at a clue.

MOVE: (3,1)

However, revisiting the clues and their order to ensure I'm not missing something crucial or misunderstanding the puzzle's logic is essential.

2025-12-10 12:57:43,952 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,1), and my path has been: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1). There are 6 filled cells out of a total of 25.

2. STRATEGY: My next goal is to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (1,1), where I am currently sitting! However, since I've already visited this clue, my next target should be the highest numbered clue that hasn't been visited yet, which is either not among the options or I need to follow the ascending order. Since we're in a 5x5 grid and following the ascending order of clues (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...), Clue 4 at position (3,0) comes next.

However, considering the given available next moves are (3,1) and (2,2), it seems I should prioritize visiting the next clue after (1,1). Since we're on a grid with ascending order, let's check if there is any other clue that hasn't been mentioned yet: Clue 2 at position (4,2) has been visited but not in sequence; hence, let's look for the highest unvisited one. Given the rules and my current situation, I should proceed to visit Clues following the ascending order after visiting (1,1).

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 12:57:59,408 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,1), which means I'm in the third row and first column of the grid. According to the visual board state, I have filled 7 out of 25 cells so far. My path taken is (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1).

2. STRATEGY: The next clue I need to visit is Clue 4, which is not provided in the clue locations. However, it's mentioned that we have a total of 25 cells and clues are numbered from 1 to the highest number. Since there are only three clues given (1, 2, and 3), the next clue must be at position (0,4). Therefore, I should aim for visiting this position.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
	* Moving to (4,1) would get me closer to Clue 4 but might not necessarily be the most efficient path.
	* Moving to (3,0) would take me in a slightly different direction and does not seem directly beneficial for reaching Clue 4 quickly.
	* Moving to (3,2) is an attempt to go around and reach Clue 4 more efficiently.

However, given the visual board state and the clues provided, I should be aiming for the next clue that hasn't been mentioned yet. Since it's implied we need to visit all cells in ascending order after the last mentioned clue (Clue 3), we actually are aiming for the first empty space that leads us towards Clue 4 logically.

Considering this logic and the board state, I realize that my previous understanding was incorrect regarding moving towards an unseen Clue 4 directly. The correct next step is to follow the ascending order of clues as provided (1 -> 2 -> 3), and since we are at position (3,1) after visiting clues up to Clue 3, our next logical step should be to revisit a clue or fill empty cells in such a way that respects the ascending order.

Given this correction:
- Since my current path has already visited clues up to 3, the next move logically is not directly aiming for an unseen future clue but rather ensuring we adhere to the given puzzle rules and strategy.

Upon reevaluation, considering we need to fill empty cells between clues as needed and respect the ascending order:

The logical step after visiting Clue 3 should be to revisit a clue or proceed in a way that fills these gaps correctly. Since there is an available move towards (4,2), which is the location of Clue 2, this seems like a direct continuation of the path, ensuring we visit all clues in ascending order without skipping any.

Therefore:

MOVE: (3,0)

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (4,0) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. Looking at the board, I can see that I've visited clues 1 and 3, which means clue 2 is next in order. Clue 2 is located at position (4,2). From my current position, I can move to (4,1) as per the available moves.

STRATEGY:
I should visit clue 2 next, but since it's already filled and not empty, I need to find a path that allows me to reach it in ascending order. Therefore, I don't necessarily have to go directly to clue 2 at position (4,2).

EVALUATION:
For each available move, the pros and cons are:

* Move to (4,1): This move is already provided as an option and seems like a logical step, allowing me to potentially fill empty cells on the way to future clues.
* Other possible moves would involve backtracking or going out of order.

DECISION:
Based on my current situation and the need to visit clue 2 in ascending order, I should choose the available next move.

I am currently at position (4,1), and according to the current game state, I have filled 10 out of 25 cells. Looking at the available next moves, my goal is to visit clue 2, which is located at position (4,2). However, I can only move horizontally or vertically, and there's a higher numbered clue nearby.

STRATEGY:
Since my task is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path while visiting all clues in ascending order, the next step would be to visit clue 2. It's strategically important because it allows me to reach the highest numbered clue efficiently.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (4,3) and (4,0).

Pros of moving to (4,3):
- I'll be closer to the next possible move, potentially leading to fewer moves in the future.
- Moving right might open up new paths or lead me towards higher numbered clues.

Cons:
- I'm not directly reaching clue 2; it's still one move away.

Pros of moving to (4,0):
- This would take me one step closer to clue 2.

Cons:
- Moving left doesn't necessarily advance the path toward higher-numbered clues as effectively as moving right could in other scenarios.

DECISION:
Given that my current position is (4,1) and I'm aiming for a continuous path while visiting all clues, moving left directly to clue 2 would be the most straightforward choice at this juncture. It ensures I stay on track with ascending order and minimizes the risk of backtracking or missing out on cells.

Given that my current position is (4,1) and I'm aiming for a continuous path while visiting all clues, moving left directly to clue 2 would be the most straightforward choice at this juncture. It ensures I stay on track with ascending order and minimizes the risk of backtracking or missing out on cells.

🧠 OLLAMA THINKING (Move 11):
--------------------------------------------------
I am currently at position (4,1), and according to the current game state, I have filled 10 out of 25 cells. Looking at the available next moves, my goal is to visit clue 2, which is located at position (4,2). However, I can only move horizontally or vertically, and there's a higher numbered clue nearby.

STRATEGY:
Since my task is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path while visiting all clues in ascending order, the next step would be to visit clue 2. It's strategically important because it allows me to reach the highest numbered clue efficiently.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (4,3) and (4,0).

Pros of moving to (4,3):
- I'll be closer to the next possible move, potentially leading to fewer moves in the future.
- Moving right might open up new paths or lead me towards higher numbered clues.

Cons:
- I'm not directly reaching clue 2; it's still one move away.

Pros of moving to (4,0):
- This would take me one step closer to clue 2.

Cons:
- Moving left doesn't necessarily advance the path toward higher-numbered clues as effectively as moving right could in other scenarios.

DECISION:
Given that my current position is (4,1) and I'm aiming for a continuous path while visiting all clues, moving left directly to clue 2 would be the most straightforward choice at this juncture. It ensures I stay on track with ascending order and minimizes the risk of backtracking or missing out on cells.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (4,1), which is one row above and one column to the left of clue number 2, and I have already visited clue 1. From my current path, I can see that I've been moving downwards, trying to reach the top-right corner where all the clues are located. Now, I need to decide what to do next.

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue 3, which is located at position (1,1). This will help me move towards the center of the board and eventually get closer to clue number 4 and higher.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (4,2) is directly above my current position. I can move there, but it's not a necessary step since it doesn't bring me any closer to my goal. Alternatively, I could move (3,0), which gets me one row below and directly adjacent to clue number 3.

MOVE:
Since moving to (4,2) is unnecessary and moving down to (3,0) brings me directly adjacent to the next clue, I will choose the latter.

I am currently at position (4,1) and have filled 10 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at position (1,1). However, my current position is already on top of the clue location. Therefore, I will need to choose a move that gets me closer to clue 3.

My goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path and end at the highest numbered clue, which is currently clue 3. I should aim to visit clues in ascending order, but since clue 3's position is not far from my current location, I can focus on getting there efficiently.

EVALUATION:
The available next moves are (4,2), but this would take me away from the intended path towards clue 3. Since (4,2) is a valid move according to the rules and doesn't block any future paths, I should consider it as an option.

However, since my current position is not on top of clue 3's location and I need to visit clues in ascending order, visiting another clue first might be beneficial. The puzzle does not specify how to treat tied positions for multiple clues, so we will have to follow the given rules and instructions provided by the puzzle creator.

DECISION:
Considering all factors and available information, I should choose a move that gets me closer to clue 3 while also considering visiting other clues in ascending order.

Since clue locations are specified and following the path taken thus far, it is logical to continue exploring the most direct route to clue 3. However, without additional options, the best choice given my current position (4,1) would be to move towards a location that aligns with this goal of visiting clue 3 first while also considering the puzzle's constraints.

However, since we only have one next possible move according to our analysis and no other options were listed as available next moves besides (4,2), it seems more likely that we are meant to explore how we could utilize any empty space or clues in between our current position and clue 3. But given the board's constraints and the requirement for visiting all cells exactly once, this might not be directly applicable here.

MOVE:
Considering these factors, I should select a move based on getting closer to clue 3 while also considering other puzzle objectives and constraints.

Given that (4,2) is an available next move but doesn't seem to align with our goal of reaching the next clue in ascending order efficiently from my current position, another logical step would be needed if we were given more options.

Since no further steps are provided by the puzzle for us to explore and only one potential choice is presented despite our analysis suggesting that moving towards a more direct route or considering other clues first might make sense, I'm left to conclude based on available information.

Given these limitations, it's difficult to determine an optimal move directly from my current position without revisiting previous steps.

However, if we assume the provided next moves as correct and utilize the puzzle instructions for guidance, moving towards (4,2) or exploring options around clue 3 might be more beneficial based on ascending order but lacks clear direction with no other options to choose between.

MOVE:
Given that my analysis above suggests an optimal route should prioritize visiting clue 3 but acknowledges limitations in the provided next moves and given instructions for puzzle progression, I will select a move based on potential future steps and the logic of solving the puzzle.

In this case, since we have limited information to work with here and cannot directly optimize towards clue 3 without additional options or more precise guidance from previous puzzle states or available board positions beyond what is presented.
