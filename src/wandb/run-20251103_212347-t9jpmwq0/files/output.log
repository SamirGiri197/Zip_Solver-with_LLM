ZIP PUZZLE SOLVER

=== RULES ===
1. You must fill ALL 16 cells in the grid
2. Start at clue 1 and END at the highest clue number
3. Visit ALL numbered clues (1, 2, 3, ...) IN SEQUENCE
4. Create a continuous path - each cell connects to the next
5. Can only move to ADJACENT cells (up, down, left, right, or diagonal)
6. CANNOT revisit cells - each cell used only once
7. Between clues, you can visit any empty cells

=== CURRENT BOARD STATE ===
[ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ 5][ 6][ ][ ]
[ 3][ 4][ ][P]
[ ][ ][ 2][ ]

Legend:
[P] = Your path (visited cells)

[ ] = Empty cell (can fill)

=== GAME PROGRESS ===
Current Position: (2, 3)
Path Length: 1 / 16
Cells Filled: 1 / 16
Cells Remaining: 15

=== CLUES TO VISIT (IN THIS ORDER) ===
  Clue 1: (2, 3)
  Clue 2: (2, 0)
  Clue 3: (1, 1)

=== AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES ===
You can ONLY move to these adjacent cells:
  (1, 3)
  (3, 3)
  (2, 2)

=== YOUR TASK ===
THINK OUT LOUD about your strategy:
1. Which clue are you trying to reach next?
2. Which available move gets you closer?
3. Will this move avoid dead ends?
4. Will this keep options open for later?

Then provide your decision as JSON.

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===
First write 2-3 sentences explaining your thinking.
Then on a new line write the JSON:
{"next_move": {"row": R, "col": C}, "reason": "why this move"}

Example:
I need to move toward clue 3. Moving down keeps more cells open for exploration.

  Clue 3: (1, 1)

=== AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES ===
You can ONLY move to these adjacent cells:
  (0, 0)
  (1, 1)

=== YOUR TASK ===
THINK OUT LOUD about your strategy:
1. Which clue are you trying to reach next?
2. Which available move gets you closer?
3. Will this move avoid dead ends?
4. Will this keep options open for later?

Then provide your decision as JSON.

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===
First write 2-3 sentences explaining your thinking.
Then on a new line write the JSON:
{"next_move": {"row": R, "col": C}, "reason": "why this move"}

Example:
I need to move toward clue 3. Moving down keeps more cells open for exploration.
{"next_move": {"row": 3, "col": 2}, "reason": "heading toward next clue"}

=== RULES ===
1. You must fill ALL 16 cells in the grid
2. Start at clue 1 and END at the highest clue number
3. Visit ALL numbered clues (1, 2, 3, ...) IN SEQUENCE
4. Create a continuous path - each cell connects to the next
5. Can only move to ADJACENT cells (up, down, left, right, or diagonal)
6. CANNOT revisit cells - each cell used only once
7. Between clues, you can visit any empty cells
