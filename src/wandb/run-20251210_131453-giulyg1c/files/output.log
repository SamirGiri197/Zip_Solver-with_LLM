Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 13:15:12,427 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,0), and my task is to fill all 9 cells in one continuous path while visiting all clue numbers in ascending order. I have filled 1/9 cells so far.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit is 2. According to the puzzle rules, clue locations are not provided explicitly for clues beyond the first one. Given that we start at (2,0) with Clue 1 and need to move in a continuous path while visiting all clue numbers, it's logical to assume that Clues 2-9 will be located in the cells adjacent to or nearby Clue 1.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available next move:

   - Moving to (1,0) means going down one row and staying at column 0.
     Pros: Could potentially place clue 2 nearby but might limit options for future moves since we'd have to go around it or block further movement in that direction.
     Cons: Limits the path expansion without immediate benefit of placing clues 3-9.

   - Moving to (2,1) means staying at row 2 and moving one column to the right.
     Pros: Places us closer to potential future moves but doesn't immediately help with clue placement efficiency since it's not directly next to Clue 1 or any given clue location yet.
     Cons: Doesn’t directly contribute to placing clues in a way that might block future paths significantly.

4. DECISION:
Given the aim is to fill all cells and visit all clue numbers, moving to (2,1) seems like the better choice because it prepares us for potential expansion horizontally, which could be beneficial when navigating around and between clues. It doesn’t immediately place a higher-numbered clue but keeps options open for where to place them efficiently in future moves.

2025-12-10 13:15:25,035 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells in the path so far. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from clue 1, which is located at (2,0). My current goal is to find a way to move towards the next clue while ensuring that my path remains continuous.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is clearly clue 2, but since it's already marked on the board as [2], I need to focus on the actual location of the next available clue. In this case, I've already visited clue 1 at position (2,0), so the next clue in ascending order would be clue 3.

However, upon reviewing my path and the empty cells between clues, I realize that I should visit clue 2 first to maintain a continuous path. Clue 2 is located at position (1,1). Therefore, the next step is to find a way to move towards (1,1) while keeping in mind the rule of never revisiting any cell.

3. EVALUATION:
Given my available moves are (1,1), and (2,2), let's evaluate each:

- Move to (1,1):
  Pros: Gets me directly to Clue 2.
  Cons: Doesn't provide much exploration or flexibility beyond visiting the next clue.

- Move to (2,2):
  Pros: Provides a potential future path towards higher clues, but first I need to address the current task of moving to Clue 2.
  Cons: Risks missing an opportunity to connect with other parts of the board if it's not directly needed for reaching Clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal is to fill all cells in a continuous path and visit each clue in ascending order, the most direct and efficient move from (2,1) would be towards Clue 2 at position (1,1). While moving to (2,2) might seem like an exploratory move, it does not contribute directly to resolving my immediate task of reaching the next clue.

Therefore, I will choose the move that immediately addresses the need to visit the next clue in ascending order, which is Clue 2 at position (1,1).

2025-12-10 13:15:26,128 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (2,0)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 3/9 cells filled
Current Position: (1,1)
Path Taken: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)

Visual Board State:
  .    .    .
  .  [ 3]   2
[ 1] [ 2]   .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,1), which means I've already visited Clue 1 and have filled one cell. I'm in a relatively central location on the board, with two empty cells above me and three to my right.

2. STRATEGY:
My next move should be to visit the next highest numbered clue, which is Clue 3. According to the visual board state, Clue 3 is located at position (0,2). I need to navigate through the empty cells to reach it without revisiting any previously visited positions.

3. EVALUATION:
Available Next Moves:
- Moving to (0,1) would put me one row above, but I'd be closer to the edge of the board and might make future paths more complicated.
- Moving to (1,0) would put me one column to the left, which doesn't seem like a significant gain in progress toward Clue 3.
- Moving to (1,2) is not an available move; I must choose from the three options provided.

4. DECISION:
Considering my current position and the location of Clue 3, the most efficient next step would be to move one row down to (2,1), which allows me to stay on a relatively central path and sets me up for easier navigation toward Clue 3 without blockages or unnecessary backtracking.

2025-12-10 13:15:33,340 - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,1), which means I've already visited Clue 1 and have filled one cell. I'm in a relatively central location on the board, with two empty cells above me and three to my right.

2. STRATEGY:
My next move should be to visit the next highest numbered clue, which is Clue 3. According to the visual board state, Clue 3 is located at position (0,2). I need to navigate through the empty cells to reach it without revisiting any previously visited positions.

3. EVALUATION:
Available Next Moves:
- Moving to (0,1) would put me one row above, but I'd be closer to the edge of the board and might make future paths more complicated.
- Moving to (1,0) would put me one column to the left, which doesn't seem like a significant gain in progress toward Clue 3.
- Moving to (1,2) is not an available move; I must choose from the three options provided.

4. DECISION:
Considering my current position and the location of Clue 3, the most efficient next step would be to move one row down to (2,1), which allows me to stay on a relatively central path and sets me up for easier navigation toward Clue 3 without blockages or unnecessary backtracking.

2025-12-10 13:15:34,410 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (2,0)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 3/9 cells filled
Current Position: (1,1)
Path Taken: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)

Visual Board State:
  .    .    .
  .  [ 3]   2
[ 1] [ 2]   .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:15:43,905 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,1), having just visited clues 1 and 2 in that order. I have filled 3 out of 9 cells, and my next goal is to visit the remaining clue numbers in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
My next clue number to visit is #3. However, there isn't a direct indication of its location yet, but since we're working with a 3x3 grid, I'm assuming it will be within the same grid. Given my current position (1,1), I should try to move in a way that brings me closer to clue #3.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves are: (0,1), (1,0), and (1,2). Let's evaluate each option:

* **Move (0,1)**: If I move down to position (0,1), it doesn't seem like a promising choice for now since clue #3 is still unknown. This might not get me closer to the next clues or leave an open path for visiting future clues.

* **Move (1,0)**: Moving left to position (1,0) could potentially bring me closer to the left edge of the grid, but without knowing where clue #3 is located, it's hard to tell if this would be beneficial or not.

* **Move (1,2)**: Going right to position (1,2) seems like an attractive option since I'm already moving in a generally increasing order of clue numbers and have only partially explored the top row.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal is to move towards the next clue #3 and possibly explore more of the grid without getting stuck or blocking potential paths, I choose **MOVE: (1,2)** because it allows me to keep exploring the top row further while having some options for where clue #3 might be.

2025-12-10 13:15:44,993 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (2,0)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 4/9 cells filled
Current Position: (1,2)
Path Taken: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)

Visual Board State:

  .  [ 3] [ 4]
[ 1] [ 2]   .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (0,2), (2,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:15:51,851 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 4 out of 9 cells. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in a continuous path. The next clue I need to visit is clue 3, which is located at (0,1). However, before moving to clue 3, I should try to fill in any empty cells between my current position and the clue.

The available moves are: (0,2) or (2,2). Both of these moves would take me away from the horizontal path that leads to clue 3. Instead, I need to move vertically down towards clue 3.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (0,2) takes me to an empty cell on the same row as clue 1 and does not lead me closer to clue 3.
* Moving to (2,2) would put me in a position that is further away from clue 3 and doesn't help with filling the cells between my current position and clue 3.

DECISION:
The best move is neither of the options listed. However, if I must choose one, I should move to (0,2). This move allows me to fill an empty cell and gets me closer to revisiting the top row of the board before moving down towards clue 3.

I am currently at position (1,2), having filled 4 out of 9 cells in my path. My next step must be to visit clue number 5, which is located at position (0,2). However, before I can do that, I need to determine the best way to get there from my current position.

STRATEGY:
According to the rules, I must visit all clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest. Since I've already visited clues 1 and 3 (although the latter is not shown), my next goal should be to reach clue number 4.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (0,2) or (2,2). Let's examine each option:

* Moving to (0,2): This would immediately take me to position where I can visit clue 5. However, it might not be the best choice since it doesn't necessarily get me closer to visiting clues 4 in order.
* Moving to (2,2): From here, I could potentially visit clue 4 at position (2,1) first before moving on to clue 5.

DECISION:
Since my next goal is to visit clue number 4 and then 5 in ascending order, the best move would be to go to position (2,2). This will allow me to take a more strategic approach by visiting clues 3 and 4 before heading towards clue 5.

MOVE: (2,2)

2025-12-10 13:16:00,461 - INFO - I am currently at position (1,2), having filled 4 out of 9 cells in my path. My next step must be to visit clue number 5, which is located at position (0,2). However, before I can do that, I need to determine the best way to get there from my current position.

STRATEGY:
According to the rules, I must visit all clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest. Since I've already visited clues 1 and 3 (although the latter is not shown), my next goal should be to reach clue number 4.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (0,2) or (2,2). Let's examine each option:

* Moving to (0,2): This would immediately take me to position where I can visit clue 5. However, it might not be the best choice since it doesn't necessarily get me closer to visiting clues 4 in order.
* Moving to (2,2): From here, I could potentially visit clue 4 at position (2,1) first before moving on to clue 5.

DECISION:
Since my next goal is to visit clue number 4 and then 5 in ascending order, the best move would be to go to position (2,2). This will allow me to take a more strategic approach by visiting clues 3 and 4 before heading towards clue 5.

2025-12-10 13:16:01,504 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (2,0)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 5/9 cells filled
Current Position: (2,2)
Path Taken: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)

Visual Board State:
  .    .    .
  .  [ 3] [ 4]
[ 1] [ 2] [ 5]
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:16:06,699 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (2,0)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 5/9 cells filled
Current Position: (2,2)
Path Taken: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)

Visual Board State:
  .    .    .
  .  [ 3] [ 4]
[ 1] [ 2] [ 5]
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,2), which is my current game state's last filled cell in the given path. I have visited 5 out of 9 cells and need to fill the remaining 4 cells. Looking at the clues, the next clue number I need to visit is 3, but there is no information on its exact location yet.

However, since we are provided with a visual board state and previous moves, it seems that we have already filled in some numbers (clues) around us. Specifically, we know there is a clue 1 at position (2,0), which matches the given initial clue location.

Considering my current situation, I must re-evaluate my strategy because we were initially trying to fill empty cells between clues as needed and never revisit a cell. Since we have no available next moves mentioned in the problem statement, it seems that our previous choices led us into this predicament.

Given the constraint of visiting all clue numbers in ascending order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest), and considering we already visited clue number 1 at position (2,0) and ended up at (2,2), my next logical step should be to backtrack to clue 1's location and reassess the path from there.

However, there seems to have been a mistake in the problem statement or solution process because with our current progress, it should not say "Available Next Moves: None" given our last filled position (2,2).

Therefore, based on this situation, my next move would be backtracking to clue number 1's location at (2,0) and then proceed accordingly.

MOVE: (2,0)

Please let me know if I've correctly assessed the situation or if further clarification is needed.

Analysis: I am currently at position (2,2) with a filled path of (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2). This means I have visited clues 1 and 3, but I'm stuck since there's no next available clue to visit in the current path. There are empty cells between my current position and the last filled cell at (1,1), which suggests that I need to revisit or fill those cells to continue.

Strategy: Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order, I should aim to visit clue 2 next. Clue 2 is located at position (1,1). However, there's a catch - I've already visited clue 1 and passed by the location of clue 2 on my way to (2,2), so I need to rethink the path.

Evaluation: Considering the current board state:
- The path from (2,0) -> (2,1) creates a blocked area that prevents direct access to clue 2.
- There are empty cells at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2) below my current position. Moving down could be an option.

Decision: Given the need to visit clue 2 next and the options available, I should move down to (1,2). This will allow me to correct the path, remove blocks, and potentially get closer to visiting clue 2 without revisiting cells unnecessarily.

2025-12-10 13:16:25,283 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 1/9 cells filled
Current Position: (0,0)
Path Taken: (0,0)

Visual Board State:
[ 1]   .    4
  .    3    .
  .    2    .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (1,0), (0,1)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (0,0), which is the starting point of the puzzle with Clue 1 already visited. The goal is to visit all 9 cells in a continuous path, following the ascending order of clue numbers. I need to move towards Clue 2, located at position (0,2). Both available moves are options for me: (1,0) and (0,1).

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed Clue 2, which is currently out of reach since it's two positions ahead. To get there, I need to move in the direction that brings me closer to Clue 2.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

- Moving to (1,0) would allow me to start moving rightwards but doesn't bring me any closer to Clue 2 directly and could lead to a more complicated path later on.
- Moving to (0,1) brings me one step towards the vertical direction towards Clue 2.

DECISION:
Given that my goal is to reach Clue 2 in ascending order of clue numbers, moving to (0,1) is the most logical choice as it allows for a direct approach to Clue 2 with fewer potential complications down the line.

MOVE: (0,1)

2025-12-10 13:16:33,087 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 2/9 cells filled
Current Position: (0,1)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2]   4
  .    3    .
  .    2    .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (1,1), (0,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1), which means I'm in the second column of the first row. My current path order is 1 -> 2, and I have filled 2 out of 9 cells. The next clue number to visit in ascending order is 3.

2. STRATEGY:
To move forward, I need to find the location of Clue 3. Since it's not specified yet, I'll focus on filling the empty cell between my current position and the available moves. One possible location for Clue 3 could be an empty cell adjacent to (0,1).

3. EVALUATION:
I have two available next moves: (1,1) or (0,2). Let's evaluate each option:

* **(1,1)**: This move would allow me to fill the empty cell in the first row and second column. It also keeps me close to both my current path and a potential location for Clue 3. However, it doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2.
* **(0,2)**: Moving to (0,2) would take me to the last position of the first row. This move has two potential benefits: (1) I might find a location for Clue 3 near this cell; and (2) if there's no space for Clue 3 in the current path, moving to (0,2) could help prepare me for visiting Clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Given my current situation, both moves have advantages and disadvantages. However, considering that I'm supposed to visit all clues in ascending order and move only horizontally or vertically, **(1,1)** seems like a safer choice. It allows me to fill the empty cell between my current path and the available moves, which might help with future navigation. Additionally, moving to (0,2) could lead to unnecessary backtracking if Clue 3 is indeed located at (1,1).

2025-12-10 13:16:44,304 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 3/9 cells filled
Current Position: (1,1)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1)

Visual Board State:

Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (2,1), (1,0), (1,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:16:53,453 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 13:16:53,453 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1), having visited clue 1 and moved on from there. I have already filled 3 cells out of 9, which means I need to visit the remaining 6 clues in ascending order. Since I'm already at a cell with a relatively high clue number ([3]), my next move should aim to visit the next clue in sequence.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is clue 2, which is located at position (0,2). However, since I'm not currently at that position and can't revisit cells already visited, I must choose a path that allows me to reach clue 2 while following the rules of the puzzle.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (2,1): This would take me away from my current progress toward clue 2. Visiting this cell wouldn't bring me closer to clue 2 and might even delay reaching it.
* (1,0): Moving down one row could potentially be a good choice since I'm currently at (1,1). It keeps me moving in the general direction of clue 2 but doesn't guarantee I'll reach it next. It also leaves options for future moves that allow reaching clue 2 directly if needed.
* (1,2): Moving right from my current position gets me closer to potential paths toward clue 2 but is more cautious than moving down since it doesn't inherently get me closer to clue 2's location.

DECISION:
Considering the available moves and their implications on reaching clue 2, I think moving down one row (1,0) is the best choice. It maintains a progression towards visiting higher-numbered clues in ascending order and keeps options open for future paths that might be more direct towards clue 2 if needed.

2025-12-10 13:17:01,802 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,0), which is next to clue number 4 in a row. I have already visited clues 1 and 2, and now I need to visit the next clue in ascending order. However, there's no next numbered clue directly adjacent to my current location. Since the problem requires filling all cells in one continuous path, I must fill in the empty cell between clues 1 and 4 by visiting either (0,1) or (1,2).

STRATEGY:
The next clue I should visit is clue number 3. It's located at position (1,2).

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

A) Move to (2,0): This would put me one row below my current location but doesn't get me closer to clue number 3.

B) Move to (0,1): This gets me closer to clue number 3 and opens up the possibility of moving towards it in subsequent steps.

C) Move to (1,2): This puts me directly on top of clue number 3, but since we have a path rule that requires continuous movement after a clue, I would have to backtrack or fill empty cells between clues.

DECISION:
Considering my goal and the rules, moving to (0,1) allows for more flexibility in planning the next steps towards visiting clue number 3 while minimizing potential backtracking.

MOVE: (0,1)

2025-12-10 13:17:02,874 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 4/9 cells filled
Current Position: (1,0)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2]   4
[ 4] [ 3]   .
  .    2    .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (2,0)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (1,0), which is adjacent to Clue 1. According to the puzzle rules, my next move should visit Clue 2, which is located at position (0,2). I have already filled 4 out of 9 cells and need to continue filling in a continuous path.

2. STRATEGY: Since I need to visit Clue 2 next, I will aim for that location. My strategy is to move towards Clue 2 while considering the available moves and their potential impact on my future path.

3. EVALUATION:
	* Available Move 1: (2,0) - This would take me to a new row but not directly closer to Clue 2.
	* Pros: No cons mentioned for this move.
	* Cons: It doesn't seem to be a direct step towards Clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Considering the available moves and my strategy to visit Clue 2 next, I will choose a different move that gets me closer to it. Since (0,1) is empty and adjacent to both my current position and Clue 2, it seems like an optimal choice to move towards Clue 2.

MOVE: (1,1)

Wait, I made a mistake in the previous step! The correct next move should be (0,1), not (1,1).

2025-12-10 13:17:11,068 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 4/9 cells filled
Current Position: (1,0)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2]   4
[ 4] [ 3]   .
  .    2    .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (2,0)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:17:19,191 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,0), which is in the middle row of the board. I have filled 4 out of 9 cells so far, and my path has been: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0). I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (0,2).

2. STRATEGY:
My next goal is to reach clue 2, but I also have to consider the path leading up to it and any potential future moves that might block my way. Clue 2 is located at position (0,2), which means I'll need to move down from (1,0).

3. EVALUATION:
I can move either horizontally or vertically from my current position (1,0). My available next moves are (2,0). Let's analyze the pros and cons of each option:

- Moving to (2,0) would take me out of the way and create a gap between myself and clue 2. This might make it more difficult for me to reach clue 3, which is located at position (2,1).
- However, this move does not block any potential paths or limit future options.

4. DECISION:
Considering my next goal is to visit clue 2, moving to (2,0) actually helps me get closer to the row where clue 2 is located without blocking any possible future moves. This decision might seem counterintuitive at first, but it provides a clear path forward to reach clue 3 and ultimately clue 2.

From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:17:28,033 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0), which means I'm in the bottom left corner of the board. My current path order is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). Since I've already visited 5 cells and need to visit a total of 9 cells, I still have 4 cells left to fill. The clues are located at positions (0,0) and (0,2), but since I'm currently not near those positions, I'll focus on moving towards the next available clue number.

STRATEGY:
I should visit the next available clue number, which is clue 3. However, clue 3's position is not given directly in the clues list. We need to analyze the current state of the board and determine where a potential clue 3 might be. Looking at the current state, I see that (1,1) has a path order of 2, but there are empty cells between the current path and the next position.

EVALUATION:
From my current position (2,0), I have two available moves: (2,1). We can break down each move as follows:

Move to (2,1):
Pros:
- This move gets me closer to potential clue 3.
Cons:
- Since I'm at the bottom left corner and move up, it's not clear if this will lead me directly to a higher-numbered clue.

2025-12-10 13:17:29,223 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 6/9 cells filled
Current Position: (2,1)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2]   4
[ 4] [ 3]   .
[ 5] [ 6]   .
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (2,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 13:17:37,053 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1), which means I've already visited clues 1 and 2. However, there are still empty cells between them that need to be filled. Looking at the current path taken, it seems like I'm trying to explore all possible options around clue 2. The available next moves are indeed (0,2), but since we're at (2,1) and have already visited clues 1 and 2, moving up would not lead us closer to any new clues or empty cells.

However, there is a clue number missing between the initial path taken from (0,0) to (2,0) and our current position. It seems like we missed clue 3, which should be located at one of the positions around the starting point. Since (1,1) was filled in the previous step and (2,1) is our current position, it implies that clue 4 is likely located at position (0,2), making it our next target.

Looking closely at the board state:

[ 1] [ 2]   .
[ 4] [ 3]   .
[ 5] [ 6]   .

Since we need to fill in all clues and empty cells between them in ascending order, clue 3 is missing. It seems logical that it should be located at (0,1). Hence our next move should be towards the empty position at (0,1) which would also take us closer to filling up clue 4.

However, there is a clue number missing between the initial path taken from (0,0) to (2,0) and our current position. It seems like we missed clue 3, which should be located at one of the positions around the starting point. Since (1,1) was filled in the previous step and (2,1) is our current position, it implies that clue 4 is likely located at position (0,2), making it our next target.

Looking closely at the board state:

[ 1] [ 2]   .
[ 4] [ 3]   .
[ 5] [ 6]   .

Since we need to fill in all clues and empty cells between them in ascending order, clue 3 is missing. It seems logical that it should be located at (0,1). Hence our next move should be towards the empty position at (0,1) which would also take us closer to filling up clue 4.

2025-12-10 13:17:38,133 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 7/9 cells filled
Current Position: (2,2)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2]   4
[ 4] [ 3]   .
[ 5] [ 6] [ 7]
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (1,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:17:46,226 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,2), which is the highest numbered clue and indicates that I have filled most of the board. However, my task is to fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path, so there are still empty cells between clues that need to be filled. Looking at the visual board state, I see that I need to visit clue number 3 next, which is located at position (1,1).

Strategy:
I should aim to reach clue number 3 at position (1,1) and then continue with the ascending order of clue numbers.

Evaluation:
For each available move (1,2), I need to consider the pros and cons:

* Moving up from (2,2) to (1,2): This would bring me closer to clue number 3 but might leave me stuck without a clear path forward.
* Moving right from (2,2) to (2,1): This move is not allowed since I'm already at the edge of the board.

Since neither option involves moving diagonally or revisiting a cell, both moves seem plausible. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that if I move up to (1,2), I'll be able to reach clue number 3 more efficiently in subsequent moves.

Decision:
Considering my goal to fill ALL 9 cells and the current board state, the best next move is to go up from (2,2) to (1,2). This will set me up for a smoother path forward as I continue visiting the remaining clues in ascending order.

2025-12-10 13:17:47,371 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (0,2)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,2), and I have filled 8 out of 9 cells in one continuous path. Looking at the current game state, I can see that I've visited all clues up to this point in ascending order. However, there is still one empty cell between clue 6 and 7. My goal now is to fill this last empty cell.

2. STRATEGY:
I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at position (1,1). This move will allow me to continue the path and eventually reach the highest numbered clue, which I haven't seen yet. Since we know that there are only two cells remaining between clue 6 and 7, it's reasonable to conclude that clue 3 should be next.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move, the pros and cons can be analyzed as follows:

* Move to (2,0): This would take me away from my current path and might create a dead end.
* Move to (1,1): This is the location of clue 3, which we need to visit next. It's also adjacent to my current position and doesn't block any future paths.
* Move to (0,2): I can only move here because it's an available option given by the problem statement. However, this would take me away from my current path and might create a dead end.

4. DECISION:
Based on the analysis above, the best move is to visit clue 3 at position (1,1). This allows us to continue our ascending order, fills the necessary empty cell between clues, and moves us closer to the highest numbered clue.

I am currently at position (1,2), having filled 8 out of 9 cells. The current path taken was (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2). Since the goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue, I need to visit Clue 3 next. Unfortunately, it's not explicitly mentioned where Clue 3 is located, but given that we have already visited Clues 1 and 2, Clue 3 must be somewhere else.

Given this situation and our available moves, we can analyze each option:

- We could move to (0,2) as suggested by the puzzle. However, looking at the board state, [ 1] [ 2]   4  doesn't seem to have any empty cells that would require us to fill in a path from Clue 2 to another clue.

  Considering the available next moves and our current situation, it seems we need more information about where Clue 3 is.

However, let's proceed with what seems like an obvious move:

MOVE: (0,2)

This takes advantage of the given option without much additional analysis based on our previous steps.

2025-12-10 13:18:05,062 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 9/9 cells filled
Current Position: (0,2)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2] [ 9]
[ 4] [ 3] [ 8]
[ 5] [ 6] [ 7]
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:18:24,249 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2), having filled 8 out of 9 cells. The highest numbered clue I have not yet visited is Clue 3, which must be located at (1,1). To reach this cell, I need to move from (0,2) horizontally or vertically without revisiting any previously occupied cells.

My current path has visited all clues in ascending order except for Clue 3. Given that the board size is only 3x3 and all empty cells must be filled between clues as needed, it's likely that I can reach Clue 3 by moving to (1,1). To do this efficiently, I need to consider the constraints of not revisiting any cell.

EVALUATION:
From my current position (0,2), available moves could potentially take me back to a previously visited cell or create an obstacle for future paths. However, considering the grid's layout and my goal of reaching Clue 3 at (1,1), I can evaluate the pros and cons of each move:

- Moving up from (0,2) to (0,1): This would not get me closer to Clue 3.
- Moving right from (0,2) to (1,2): This is the same column as my current position and does not advance towards Clue 3.
- Moving down from (0,2) to (2,2): This takes me further away from Clue 3 and could potentially block a path back up.

DECISION:
Given these considerations, moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) doesn't move me towards the clue I'm trying to reach. Moving down would also not be beneficial since it moves me away from Clue 3. The best move is to move down and left from my current position at (0,2), aiming for the cell below it.

MOVE: (2,1)

However, realizing that moving directly to (2,1) bypasses an entire row of cells which are empty or have numbers already visited in ascending order, I notice a mistake in evaluating direct movement towards Clue 3 without considering the path's continuation. The optimal approach should consider filling all required empty cells while advancing towards the next clue.

Correcting my analysis: Given that the path must visit all clues in ascending order and I've reached (0,2), to find the next clue (Clue 3 at position (1,1)), the most efficient move would indeed be moving down from (0,2) to (1,2), but upon reflection, this does not adhere strictly to the path's logic. The correct approach should involve reaching Clue 3 without bypassing necessary steps or revisiting cells.

Considering my goal and the constraints:

- I must visit all clues in ascending order.
- I've reached Clue 2 at (0,2).
- My next clue is Clue 3, which should be visited after completing any necessary intermediate steps.

Given this, moving directly down to (2,1) bypasses essential intermediate steps. The most logical move after Clue 2 would indeed involve moving to an adjacent empty cell or one that can set up the path for reaching Clue 3 efficiently.

However, reflecting on the puzzle's rules and my current position at (0,2), with Clue 2 already visited and no direct moves available that don't potentially disrupt the ascending order of clue visits:

The optimal move should consider setting up a pathway to Clue 3 while ensuring all clues are visited in ascending order. This involves moving from (0,2) towards Clue 3 at (1,1), ensuring we follow the rules and visit no cell twice.

Upon careful analysis, realizing my initial conclusion was based on direct movement rather than strategic path-building:

MOVE: (1,2)

This move aims to set up a correct continuation of the path while adhering strictly to puzzle rules.

2025-12-10 13:18:25,358 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 9/9 cells filled
Current Position: (0,2)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2] [ 9]
[ 4] [ 3] [ 8]
[ 5] [ 6] [ 7]
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Your turn:

2025-12-10 13:18:37,493 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2), which is Clue 2's location. However, I need to revisit earlier clues in ascending order. My current path has visited all clues up to this point, but the empty cells between them are not filled yet. Looking at my path, I notice that I have skipped a few cells while visiting the higher-numbered clues.

The path taken so far is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2). I need to revisit the cells before Clue 1 and fill them in.

The earliest clue I skipped is Clue 3 at position (1,1), but since it's already filled, there are no empty cells between the first two clues. However, looking ahead to my next step, I can move from (0,2) back towards the top-left corner of the board.

Strategically speaking, I should revisit Clue 3 at position (1,1) is not an option since it's already filled, and instead, visit higher-numbered clues that are yet to be connected. Since my goal is to fill empty cells between clues as needed, I need to connect Clues 2 and 3 by revisiting a position between them.

Strategy:
The next clue number I should visit is Clue 4 at position (1,1), which I previously skipped while visiting the higher-numbered clues. However, since it's already filled with a different path, my real goal is to connect Clue 2 with its surrounding cells that are empty but part of the overall path.

Evaluation:
For each available move from my current position at (0,2):

- Moving to (1,2) doesn't advance in visiting clues and fills an empty cell, but it also keeps me away from connecting lower-numbered clues.
- Moving to (0,1) gets closer to a potential connection with Clue 3's surrounding cells.

Decision:
My optimal next move is to revisit the path between Clues 2 and 3 by moving back towards the top-left corner of the board. I need to fill empty cells that were skipped earlier while visiting higher-numbered clues, specifically connecting the path from (0,1) to a position where it can merge with the rest of my current path.

2025-12-10 13:18:38,644 - INFO - ============================================================
2025-12-10 13:18:38,645 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,0)
Clue 2: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 9/9 cells filled
Current Position: (0,2)
Path Taken: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)

Visual Board State:
[ 1] [ 2] [ 9]
[ 4] [ 3] [ 8]
[ 5] [ 6] [ 7]
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Your turn:

2025-12-10 13:18:52,183 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,2), which is Clue 2's location, and have filled all 9 cells in one continuous path. The current path taken is listed, but it appears to be a completed solution rather than the game state.

However, based on the provided game state, I'll assume we need to re-analyze the situation. We've visited all clue numbers in ascending order, ending at Clue 2 (position (0,2)). Since the entire board is filled and we're stuck with no available moves, it seems like a mistake or an incomplete initial analysis was given.

Given this scenario doesn't follow standard puzzle progression where there should be available next steps or an opportunity for further movement based on the rules provided, I will interpret the situation as needing to identify why we are "stuck" despite having filled all cells.

2. STRATEGY: Given that we have already visited Clue 1 (at position (0,0)) and ended at Clue 2 (position (0,2)), it seems there's a misunderstanding of where we are in the puzzle or how to analyze the situation correctly for further progress.

However, if following standard rules where we need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order before completing the board, our next logical step would be to re-evaluate Clue 3's placement and find a suitable path from (0,2).

Unfortunately, given the filled state of the board with no available moves listed and the information that all cells are filled, I will proceed under the assumption that there might have been an error in presenting the puzzle's status or how it was interpreted.

Given this unique situation, my analysis is based on correcting the apparent misunderstanding rather than a traditional path-forward strategy:

3. EVALUATION:
- There seems to be confusion between the provided game state and the expected progression of solving the puzzle.
- Typically, at Clue 2's position (0,2), one would expect several moves that haven't been listed as available, indicating we've either completed the puzzle incorrectly or there was a miscalculation in understanding where we are.

4. DECISION: Since I've concluded there seems to be an issue with how we interpret our current state and available moves, my "move" will actually attempt to rectify the situation by re-evaluating our path without new movements since we're told we're stuck despite having filled all cells:

MOVE: (Re-evaluate Puzzle State)

However, given the constraints of providing a specific row and column for a move that doesn't follow standard puzzle progression rules due to an apparent misunderstanding or error in presenting the game state, I'll clarify that this response is more about identifying the need for reassessment than suggesting new moves based on traditional puzzle strategies.
