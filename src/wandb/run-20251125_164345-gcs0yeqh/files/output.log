2025-11-25 16:43:50,486 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (0,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 1/9 cells filled
Current Position: (0,2)
Path Taken: (0,2)

Visual Board State:
  .    .  [ 1]
  .    .    3
  .    2    4
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (1,2), (0,1)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

If I move to (1,2), the path will be (0,2) -> (1,2). This move doesn't immediately block any paths, but it also doesn't directly lead me towards clue 2.
If I move to (0,1), the path will be (0,2) -> (0,1). This move also doesn't immediately block any paths, and it opens up the possibility to go down towards clue 2. It seems slightly better than going to (1,2) as it provides more flexibility.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am at position (1,0) and have filled 4 cells. I need to find the next available move to visit all 9 cells and end at the highest numbered clue. Currently, clue locations 1 is at (0,2), clue 2 is at (0,1), clue 3 is at (1,1), and clue 4 is at (2,2). I have visited clue 1, clue 2, clue 3, so the next clue to visit should be clue 4 at (2,2).
Available moves are (0,0) and (2,0).
If I move to (0,0), I will be at (0,0). Then the path would look like this: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0). From (0,0) I can go to (0,1) which I've already been to, or (1,0) which I've already been to, so this is not a good move. I would be trapped.
If I move to (2,0), I will be at (2,0). Then the path would look like this: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). From (2,0) I can go to (2,1).

Let's try the (2,0) path, I can then proceed to (2,1). Now I need to reach (2,2) which is clue 4. If I proceed to (2,1), then I can go to (2,2). So (2,0) is the optimal move.

2025-11-25 16:44:09,740 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)
