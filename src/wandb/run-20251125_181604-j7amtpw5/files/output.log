MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 7 cells. There are no more clues to visit directly. My objective is to visit all 25 cells in a continuous path. My available moves are (3,0) and (2,1).

If I move to (3,0), I can then move to (4,0), potentially trapping myself in the bottom-left corner and making it difficult to reach the upper-right portion of the board. It would force me to move along the bottom row and back up.

If I move to (2,1), I keep my options more open for reaching the rest of the board. It seems like a better strategy to head towards the center of the board and avoid getting trapped early on.

If I move to (2,1), I keep my options more open for reaching the rest of the board. It seems like a better strategy to head towards the center of the board and avoid getting trapped early on.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (3,2) and have filled 10 cells. There are no more numbered clues left, so the goal is to visit all remaining empty cells (15 of them) and ensure the path ends at the highest number, which in this case will be position 25.
Available moves are (4,2), (3,1), and (3,3).
Moving to (4,2) seems reasonable. It opens up the bottom row and doesn't immediately block anything.
Moving to (3,1) might be risky because it could potentially isolate the cells (3,0) and (4,0), making them unreachable without revisiting a cell.
Moving to (3,3) also seems acceptable. It gives access to the (3,4) and (2,3) cells.

Let's consider the long-term consequences of each move.
If I go to (4,2), then I could go to (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), and then I am stuck unless I go back to (3,0). So it will create a dead end.
If I go to (3,3), I could then go to (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), which seems like a reasonable path.
If I go to (3,1), it feels restrictive.

Therefore, the best move is (3,3).

If I go to (4,2), then I could go to (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), and then I am stuck unless I go back to (3,0). So it will create a dead end.
If I go to (3,3), I could then go to (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), which seems like a reasonable path.
If I go to (3,1), it feels restrictive.

Therefore, the best move is (3,3).

🧠 GEMINI THINKING (Move 11):
--------------------------------------------------
I am currently at position (3,2) and have filled 10 cells. There are no more numbered clues left, so the goal is to visit all remaining empty cells (15 of them) and ensure the path ends at the highest number, which in this case will be position 25.
Available moves are (4,2), (3,1), and (3,3).
Moving to (4,2) seems reasonable. It opens up the bottom row and doesn't immediately block anything.
Moving to (3,1) might be risky because it could potentially isolate the cells (3,0) and (4,0), making them unreachable without revisiting a cell.
Moving to (3,3) also seems acceptable. It gives access to the (3,4) and (2,3) cells.

Let's consider the long-term consequences of each move.
If I go to (4,2), then I could go to (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), and then I am stuck unless I go back to (3,0). So it will create a dead end.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (2,4) and have filled 13 cells. There are 25 cells in total. The next clue to visit is clue number 3. I have already visited clue 3. There is no clue to visit after clue number 2. Therefore I must continue the path until I have visited every cell exactly once, and then the puzzle is solved.

The available next moves are (1,4) and (2,3).

If I move to (1,4), I would be at (1,4). This seems reasonable because the path needs to fill out the upper right corner and avoid cutting off the lower part of the board.
If I move to (2,3), I would be at (2,3). This might cut off a large portion of the board if I am not careful.
Therefore, I should prioritize (1,4) as it seems more natural.

I have already visited clue 3. There is no clue to visit after clue number 2. Therefore I must continue the path until I have visited every cell exactly once, and then the puzzle is solved.

The available next moves are (1,4) and (2,3).

If I move to (1,4), I would be at (1,4). This seems reasonable because the path needs to fill out the upper right corner and avoid cutting off the lower part of the board.
If I move to (2,3), I would be at (2,3). This might cut off a large portion of the board if I am not careful.
Therefore, I should prioritize (1,4) as it seems more natural.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am at (1,2) and have filled 16 cells. I need to find a path to fill all 25 cells, visiting each cell exactly once and respecting the constraints. Looking at the board, I am effectively trapped. The path is blocked. Reviewing my moves, it appears I made a mistake earlier. I should not have gone to (1,3) -> (1,4).

Let's rethink from position (3,2) after visiting 10 cells. From (3,2) I went to (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). Instead, let's explore going to (4,2) from (3,2) at position 10.

If the path is (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2), then I should go to (4,2) which would become cell 11. From (4,2) let's go to (4,3) which would be cell 12. Then to (4,4) which would be cell 13. Then to (3,4) which would be cell 14. Then to (3,3) which would be cell 15. Then to (2,3) which would be cell 16. Then to (1,3) which would be cell 17. Then to (0,3) which is the clue. Wait a minute... that clue has already been visited.

I am stuck. I need to restart the puzzle from scratch.

The puzzle is unsolvable because the provided path gets boxed in. There is no legal next move.

Let's rethink from position (3,2) after visiting 10 cells. From (3,2) I went to (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). Instead, let's explore going to (4,2) from (3,2) at position 10.

If the path is (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2), then I should go to (4,2) which would become cell 11. From (4,2) let's go to (4,3) which would be cell 12. Then to (4,4) which would be cell 13. Then to (3,4) which would be cell 14. Then to (3,3) which would be cell 15. Then to (2,3) which would be cell 16. Then to (1,3) which would be cell 17. Then to (0,3) which is the clue. Wait a minute... that clue has already been visited.

I am stuck. I need to restart the puzzle from scratch.

The puzzle is unsolvable because the provided path gets boxed in. There is no legal next move.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 16 cells. I need to find a way to visit all 25 cells. I am stuck because all adjacent cells (0,2), (1,1), (2,2), (1,3) are already occupied. This means my current path is not a valid solution. I need to backtrack and find a different path earlier in the sequence. Let's go back to the start and rethink.

The initial moves are dictated by clues 1 and 2. The path (0,4) -> (0,3) is mandatory. After that, I chose (0,2). However, a different choice is to go from (0,3) to (1,3). Let's explore that possibility.

Let's reset and try a different path after visiting clue 2 at (0,3). The goal is to visit (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).

THINKING:
Since I'm stuck at position (1,2) with no valid moves forward, it indicates a problem with the earlier path. Let's retrace the steps and see where a mistake could have been made.

Current Path: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2)

After visiting (0,3), the move to (0,2) might have been a mistake. Let's try a different approach from (0,3).
From (0,3), go to (1,3). From (1,3), I can go to (1,4), (2,3), (1,2), or (0,3). Since I can't revisit cells, the only viable move is (1,4).

Let's try starting over with the revised path:
(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)
Now, from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (0,2). But (2,2) is already visited, so go to (0,2) -> ...

This revised start seems more promising. Let's stick to the current state and see if we can fix it.

Given the current state and the fact that I am stuck, the only solution is to restart the puzzle and find a different path from the beginning.

MOVE: None (Restart)

Now, from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (0,2). But (2,2) is already visited, so go to (0,2) -> ...

This revised start seems more promising. Let's stick to the current state and see if we can fix it.

Given the current state and the fact that I am stuck, the only solution is to restart the puzzle and find a different path from the beginning.

🧠 GEMINI THINKING (Move 17):
--------------------------------------------------
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 16 cells. I need to find a way to visit all 25 cells. I am stuck because all adjacent cells (0,2), (1,1), (2,2), (1,3) are already occupied. This means my current path is not a valid solution. I need to backtrack and find a different path earlier in the sequence. Let's go back to the start and rethink.

The initial moves are dictated by clues 1 and 2. The path (0,4) -> (0,3) is mandatory. After that, I chose (0,2). However, a different choice is to go from (0,3) to (1,3). Let's explore that possibility.

Let's reset and try a different path after visiting clue 2 at (0,3). The goal is to visit (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).

THINKING:
Since I'm stuck at position (1,2) with no valid moves forward, it indicates a problem with the earlier path. Let's retrace the steps and see where a mistake could have been made.

Current Path: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2)

After visiting (0,3), the move to (0,2) might have been a mistake. Let's try a different approach from (0,3).
From (0,3), go to (1,3). From (1,3), I can go to (1,4), (2,3), (1,2), or (0,3). Since I can't revisit cells, the only viable move is (1,4).

Let's try starting over with the revised path:
(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)
Now, from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (0,2). But (2,2) is already visited, so go to (0,2) -> ...
