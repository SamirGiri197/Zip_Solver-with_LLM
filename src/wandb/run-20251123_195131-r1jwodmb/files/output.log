2025-11-23 19:51:35,906 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 16 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 4x4
