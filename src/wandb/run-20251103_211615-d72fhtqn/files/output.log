ZIP PUZZLE SOLVER

=== RULES ===
1. You must fill ALL 64 cells in the grid
2. Start at clue 1 and END at the highest clue number
3. Visit ALL numbered clues (1, 2, 3, ...) IN SEQUENCE
4. Create a continuous path - each cell connects to the next
5. Can only move to ADJACENT cells (up, down, left, right, or diagonal)
6. CANNOT revisit cells - each cell used only once
7. Between clues, you can visit any empty cells

=== CURRENT BOARD STATE ===

Legend:
[P] = Your path (visited cells)
[#] = Numbered clue (must visit in order)
[ ] = Empty cell (can fill)

=== GAME PROGRESS ===
Current Position: (5, 3)
Path Length: 1 / 64
Cells Filled: 1 / 64
Cells Remaining: 63

=== CLUES TO VISIT (IN THIS ORDER) ===
  Clue 1: (5, 3)
  Clue 2: (4, 7)

=== AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES ===
You can ONLY move to these adjacent cells:
  (4, 3)
  (6, 3)
  (5, 2)
  (5, 4)

=== YOUR TASK ===
1. Choose ONE cell from "AVAILABLE NEXT MOVES"
2. Move there to continue filling the grid
3. Eventually reach the highest clue number
4. Fill all remaining empty cells

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===
Return ONLY this JSON:
{"next_move": {"row": R, "col": C}, "reason": "why this move"}

Choose wisely to avoid getting stuck!
