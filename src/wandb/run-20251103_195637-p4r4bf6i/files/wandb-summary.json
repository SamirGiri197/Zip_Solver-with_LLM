(0,3) is already occupied by 1 and (2,4) already holds the fixed number 12, so they cannot host 3.  The remaining cells are all empty, but we must avoid placing 3 in a location that would block the later forced numbers (especially 8 at (3,2) and 7 at (0,0)).  Choosing the diagonal up‑right cell (0,4) keeps the top‑right region open for the early part of the snake‑like path, stays away from column 2 (where the fixed 8 resides), and does not create a dead‑end that would isolate the cluster of low numbers (4‑6‑7) on the left side of the grid.  Therefore the most logical next step for number 3 is to move to (0,4).\",\n    \"suggested_sequence\": [\n        {\"row\": 0, \"col\": 4},   // place 3\n        {\"row\": 0, \"col\": 5},   // possible placement for 4 (continue exploring top row)\n        {\"row\": 0, \"col\": 6},   // possible placement for 5\n        {\"row\": 1, \"col\": 6}    // continue towards the centre before heading down to the fixed numbers\n    ],\n    \"confidence\": 0.62\n}","model":"gpt-oss:120b-cloud","_timestamp":1.762217904294526e+09}
