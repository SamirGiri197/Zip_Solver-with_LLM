=== RULES ===
1. You must fill ALL 64 cells in the grid
2. Start at clue 1 and END at the highest clue number
3. Visit ALL numbered clues (1, 2, 3, ...) IN SEQUENCE
4. Create a continuous path - each cell connects to the next
5. Can only move to ADJACENT cells (up, down, left, right, or diagonal)
6. CANNOT revisit cells - each cell used only once
7. Between clues, you can visit any empty cells
