2025-11-23 20:06:11,225 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - To start solving the puzzle:

1. I'm currently at position (0,2).
2. The next clue number to visit is 2.
3. To get closer to the next clue (2), I can move either horizontally or vertically from my current position (0,2).
   - Moving horizontally: I could go left to (0,1) or right to (0,3).
   - Moving vertically: I could go up to (1,2).
4. Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and the next clue is 2, it should be located at a position with a column value of 1.
   Given this condition, moving horizontally left from my current position will get me closer to the next clue.

Move: (0,1)

2025-11-23 20:06:18,156 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - I'll think step by step as requested.

1. Where are you now?
You're at (0,2) according to the Current Game State.

2. What clue number should you visit next?
Next in order is Clue 2, so you need to head towards (1,?) or move left/right from your current position to get closer to Clue 2's location which will be revealed as soon as we determine its cell position.



3. What empty cells can you move to that get you closer to the next clue?
To reach the next clue, you have three available moves: (1,2), (0,1), or (0,3). You are currently at Clue 1's location which is also (0,2) and need to reach the next numbered clue.



4. Which move keeps your path connected and valid?
Since all empty cells will be filled as part of the solution, you should choose the move that leads directly towards the location where Clue 2 would logically reside based on the ascending order.



Considering these factors and choosing a logical next step given the ascending order rule (visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order), I'll select the most direct path toward the top-left from your current position since it's an empty cell.
