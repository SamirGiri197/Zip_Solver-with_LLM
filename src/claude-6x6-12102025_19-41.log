Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 19:41:41,664 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,3) - This is clue 1 (starting position)
- Cells filled: 1/36
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (3,3)
- Available moves from (5,3): (4,3), (5,2), (5,4)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at (3,3). From (5,3), I need to move upward (decreasing row number) to reach (3,3). The most direct path would be to move straight up through (4,3).

3. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

Move (4,3) - Moving up:
- PROS: This moves directly toward clue 2 at (3,3), which is only one more step away
- PROS: Maintains a straight path, efficient
- CONS: None significant - this is the direct route

Move (5,2) - Moving left:
- PROS: Opens up the left side of row 5
- CONS: Takes me away from clue 2 at (3,3)
- CONS: Would require a longer detour to reach clue 2

Move (5,4) - Moving right:
- PROS: Opens up the right side of row 5
- CONS: Takes me away from clue 2 at (3,3)
- CONS: Would require a longer detour to reach clue 2

4. DECISION:
The best move is (4,3) because:
- It's the most direct path to clue 2 at (3,3)
- Moving straight up maintains efficiency
- After reaching (4,3), I'll be one step away from clue 2
- This doesn't create any obvious path-blocking issues for visiting the remaining clues (3, 4, 5, 6)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,3)
- Cells filled: 3/36
- Path so far: (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3)
- I started at clue 1 at position (5,3)
- Available moves: (2,3), (3,2), (3,4)

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the board, I can see the following clues:
- Clue 1: (5,3) - Already visited (start)
- Clue 3: (3,5) - visible on the board
- Clue 4: (1,3) - visible on the board
- Clue 5: (0,2) - visible on the board
- Clue 6: (0,5) - visible on the board

Since I've started at clue 1, I need to make my way through the board visiting clues in order. However, I notice there's no clue 2 visible on the board! This means clue 2 must be one of the cells I need to designate in my path.

Wait, let me reconsider - the puzzle shows my current path as [1], [2], [3] which means:
- [1] at (5,3) - clue 1
- [2] at (4,3) - this was just a path cell
- [3] at (3,3) - my current position

Looking again at the clues on the board, I need to reach:
- Next clue 3 at position (3,5)
- Then clue 4 at (1,3)
- Then clue 5 at (0,2)
- Finally clue 6 at (0,5)

3. EVALUATION:
From (3,3), my options are:
- (2,3): Moving up - this heads toward clue 4 at (1,3), but away from clue 3 at (3,5)
- (3,2): Moving left - this moves away from clue 3 at (3,5)
- (3,4): Moving right - this moves toward clue 3 at (3,5), which should be my next target

Since clue 3 is at (3,5) and I'm at (3,3), the most direct path is to move right through (3,4) to reach (3,5).

4. DECISION:
Moving to (3,4) is optimal because:
- It moves me directly toward clue 3 at (3,5)
- It keeps me on the same row, allowing efficient movement
- From (3,4), I can reach (3,5) in the next move
- This doesn't prematurely block access to other areas of the board

- [3] at (3,3) - my current position

Looking again at the clues on the board, I need to reach:
- Next clue 3 at position (3,5)
- Then clue 4 at (1,3)
- Then clue 5 at (0,2)
- Finally clue 6 at (0,5)

3. EVALUATION:
From (3,3), my options are:
- (2,3): Moving up - this heads toward clue 4 at (1,3), but away from clue 3 at (3,5)
- (3,2): Moving left - this moves away from clue 3 at (3,5)
- (3,4): Moving right - this moves toward clue 3 at (3,5), which should be my next target

Since clue 3 is at (3,5) and I'm at (3,3), the most direct path is to move right through (3,4) to reach (3,5).

4. DECISION:
Moving to (3,4) is optimal because:
- It moves me directly toward clue 3 at (3,5)
- It keeps me on the same row, allowing efficient movement
- From (3,4), I can reach (3,5) in the next move
- This doesn't prematurely block access to other areas of the board

2025-12-10 19:43:03,166 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (2,5) - top right area of the board
- Cells filled: 6/36
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (5,3), moved up and right to current position (2,5)

**Available Moves:**
1. (1,5) - Move up one row
2. (2,4) - Move left one column

**Clue Analysis:**
I only see clue 1 at position (5,3) which I've already visited. Since the puzzle requires visiting clues in ascending order (1 -> 2 -> 3...), I need to look for where clue 2 might be, but it's not explicitly shown in the clue locations list. This means I need to create a path that allows me to visit all 36 cells efficiently.

**Strategic Considerations:**
Since I'm at (2,5) in the upper right corner, I have limited options:
- The board is 6x6 (36 cells total)
- I've filled 6 cells in a somewhat vertical path with a turn
- I need to eventually fill all remaining 30 cells

**Evaluating Each Move:**

*Option 1: Move to (1,5)*
- This takes me further up and into the corner (row 1, rightmost column)
- From (1,5), I would only have two possible next moves: (0,5) or back to (2,5) (already visited) or (1,4)
- This could trap me in the upper right corner early
- However, it does allow me to potentially sweep along the top row

*Option 2: Move to (2,4)*
- This moves me left, away from the edge
- From (2,4), I would have more flexibility: can go to (2,3), (1,4), or potentially (2,5) (already visited)
- This keeps more options open
- However, I notice (2,4) is marked on the visual board, and (3,4) is already in my path

Wait, let me recheck the visual board:
- Row 2 (index 2): Shows a "6" at position (2,5) which is my current position
- Row 3 (index 3): Shows [3] at (3,3), [4] at (3,4), [5] at (3,5)

Looking at the pattern, I'm building a path. Since I'm in the upper right area with only 6 cells filled out of 36, I need to be strategic about not boxing myself in.

**Decision:**
Moving to (1,5) allows me to continue upward and then potentially sweep left along row 1, then continue with a systematic coverage pattern. If I go to (2,4) now, I might create awkward constraints given that (3,4) is already visited.

The safer move is (1,5) to continue toward the corner, then sweep systematically.

2025-12-10 19:43:21,741 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,5) and have filled 7 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (1,5) in the top-right area of the board
   - Cells filled: 7/36
   - Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (5,3), moved up and right to current position
   - Available moves: (0,5) - moving up, or (1,4) - moving left
   - I only see one clue (clue 1), so there may be other clues I need to discover or they're marked on the visual board

2. STRATEGY:
   Looking at the visual board, I can see numbered clues:
   - Clue 1: (5,3) - already visited (starting point)
   - Clue 4: (1,3) - visible on the board
   - Clue 5: (0,2) - visible on the board  
   - Clue 6: (0,5) - visible on the board
   
   Since I need to visit clues in ascending order and I've visited clue 1, I need to find and visit clues 2, 3, etc. However, I don't see clue 2 or 3 explicitly marked on the current visual board beyond my path markers.
   
   Wait, looking more carefully at the visual board legend, the bracketed numbers [1], [2], etc. represent my path order, while unbracketed numbers are clue numbers. So:
   - Clue 4 is at (1,3)
   - Clue 5 is at (0,2)
   - Clue 6 is at (0,5)
   
   Since I've only visited clue 1, I need to find clues 2 and 3 next.

3. EVALUATION:
   - Move to (0,5): This reaches clue 6, but I need to visit clues in order (2, 3, 4, 5 first). However, I don't see where clues 2 and 3 are located on the board. This could be problematic if I box myself in.
   
   - Move to (1,4): This moves me left, keeping options open to explore more of the board and potentially find clues 2 and 3. This seems safer as it doesn't commit me to a corner.

   Since I can only see clue 1 in the clue locations list, but the visual board shows clues 4, 5, and 6, I suspect clues 2 and 3 might be elsewhere on the board, or I need to pass through their locations. Moving to (1,4) gives me more flexibility to explore the board and find the next required clues.

4. DECISION:
   I should move to (1,4) to maintain flexibility and avoid boxing myself into the corner before finding all the clues I need to visit in order. This keeps more of the board accessible and allows me to explore for clues 2 and 3.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,4)
- Cells filled: 8/36
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (5,3), moved up and right, currently at (1,4)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (0,2)
- Available moves: (0,4), (2,4), (1,3)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to reach clue 2 at position (0,2). From (1,4), I need to move left and up to get there. Let me examine the path possibilities:
- Clue 2 is at (0,2), which is 2 columns to the left and 1 row up from my current position

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (0,4)
- This moves me up one row, getting me to row 0 (same row as clue 2)
- From (0,4), I could then move left toward (0,2)
- Path would be: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) to reach clue 2
- This seems like a direct approach
- Concern: Need to ensure I don't trap myself in the top section

Option B: Move to (2,4)
- This moves me down, away from clue 2
- Would require more moves to eventually reach (0,2)
- This seems inefficient for reaching the next clue

Option C: Move to (1,3)
- This moves me left toward clue 2's column
- From (1,3), I would still need to navigate to (0,2)
- Could go (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) or (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)
- This provides flexibility but uses more moves

Considering the full puzzle: I have 28 more cells to fill after this move. The top-left section (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) is mostly empty and needs to be filled. Moving to (0,4) allows me to work along row 0 toward clue 2, then I can snake down through the left side of the board.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (0,4) is the best choice because:
- It gets me closer to clue 2 efficiently
- It positions me on the same row as clue 2
- From there, I can move left along row 0 to reach clue 2
- This doesn't create obvious dead-ends or trap scenarios
- It allows for systematic coverage of the remaining board

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,3)
- Progress: 10/36 cells filled
- I started at clue 1 at (5,3) and have been moving in a snake-like pattern
- Path so far: Started bottom-middle, went up to (3,3), then right to the edge at (3,5), went up the right column to (1,5), then left to (0,4), and now at (0,3)

2. STRATEGY:
- I only see one clue (clue 1) in the puzzle, which means I need to visit all 36 cells in one continuous path starting and ending at clue 1's position
- Since there's only one clue, my goal is to create a Hamiltonian path that visits all 36 cells exactly once
- I need to be careful not to trap myself or create unreachable cells

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves: (1,3) and (0,2)

Option A: Move to (1,3)
- This moves down from my current position
- Looking at the board, I've already filled the right side from rows 1-3
- Moving to (1,3) would allow me to continue working on the left portions of the board
- I would have access to unfilled cells in the middle-left area
- This seems to maintain connectivity to the remaining unfilled cells

Option B: Move to (0,2)
- This moves left along the top row
- Would continue filling the top row from right to left
- After (0,2), I could go to (0,1), then (0,0), which would fill the top-left corner
- However, this might create issues later as I'd be working myself into a corner
- The top-left area needs careful planning to avoid getting trapped

4. DECISION:
Looking at the overall board structure, I need to ensure I don't isolate any cells. Moving to (0,2) allows me to continue along the top row, which is a natural continuation. From (0,2), I can access (0,1), (0,0), and then work my way down the left column. This follows a systematic approach that's less likely to create isolated cells.

Moving to (1,3) would jump down prematurely and might make it harder to fill the top-left corner efficiently later.

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- I am at position (0,2) 
- I've filled 11 out of 36 cells
- I started at clue 1 at (5,3) and have been building a path
- My available moves are: (1,2) and (0,1)
- I only have one clue (clue 1), so there are no more clues to visit in order
- Since there's only one clue, I need to create a path that visits all 36 cells, starting from clue 1 and ending wherever the path naturally completes

**2. STRATEGY:**
- With only one clue, my goal is to fill all 36 cells in one continuous path
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or create unreachable areas
- Currently, I'm in the top row. I need to efficiently cover the remaining 25 cells
- Looking at the board, the left side (columns 0, 1, 2) in rows 0-2 is largely unexplored
- I should work systematically to avoid creating isolated pockets

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

**Move to (1,2):**
- Goes down from (0,2) to (1,2)
- This would allow me to continue exploring the left-middle area
- From (1,2), I could access (2,2), (1,1), or back to (0,2) [already visited]
- This keeps options open for covering the left side of the board

**Move to (0,1):**
- Goes left from (0,2) to (0,1) 
- This continues along the top row moving left
- From (0,1), I could access (0,0), (1,1), or back to (0,2) [already visited]
- This would commit me to finishing the top-left corner first

**4. DECISION:**

Looking at the board structure, I need to efficiently cover all remaining cells. The left side of the board (columns 0-2, rows 0-5) has many unvisited cells. 

If I go to (0,1), I'd be moving along the top edge, which could lead to (0,0), then I'd need to snake down. This is a valid approach.

If I go to (1,2), I drop down and can work through the middle-left area more flexibly.

Given that I'm already at the top and the entire left portion is empty, moving to **(0,1)** makes sense as it allows me to sweep across the top row first, then work my way down the left side systematically. This creates a more natural snake pattern that's less likely to trap me.

2025-12-10 19:44:44,274 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,1)
- Progress: 12/36 cells filled
- I've visited clue 1 at (5,3) and am working my way through the board
- Available moves: (1,1) or (0,0)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1), I need to create a path that visits all 36 cells
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or create unreachable cells
- With 24 cells remaining, I must be careful about the path structure

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This moves me down and keeps me in the interior of the board
- From (1,1), I could access: (1,0), (2,1), or potentially (1,2) in future
- Looking at the board, if I go to (1,1), I can continue to (1,0), then work down the left column
- This creates a systematic sweep pattern

Option B: Move to (0,0)
- This moves me to the top-left corner
- From (0,0), I would only have one exit: (1,0)
- This forces a very specific path continuation
- Going to a corner early could be risky as it limits options

4. DECISION:
Let me think about the overall path strategy. I've filled the right side and top-right portion. I need to cover:
- The entire left side (column 0): 6 cells
- The middle sections (columns 1-2): many cells
- The bottom sections that aren't yet visited

If I go to (0,0) now, I'm forced into (1,0), and then I'd need to snake down or across. 

If I go to (1,1) first, I have more flexibility. From (1,1) I could go to (1,0), then (0,0), creating a cleaner path that sweeps the top-left corner properly.

Actually, let me reconsider: Moving to (1,1) gives me access to more of the board's interior, which I need to fill. From (1,1), I can strategically work through the middle sections before being forced into tight spaces.

Moving to (0,0) boxes me into the corner immediately, which is generally not ideal unless it's necessary for the path design.

The better move is (1,1) as it maintains more flexibility and allows me to systematically fill the remaining cells.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 19:44:44,333 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 19:44:44,336 - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,1)
- Progress: 12/36 cells filled
- I've visited clue 1 at (5,3) and am working my way through the board
- Available moves: (1,1) or (0,0)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1), I need to create a path that visits all 36 cells
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or create unreachable cells
- With 24 cells remaining, I must be careful about the path structure

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This moves me down and keeps me in the interior of the board
- From (1,1), I could access: (1,0), (2,1), or potentially (1,2) in future
- Looking at the board, if I go to (1,1), I can continue to (1,0), then work down the left column
- This creates a systematic sweep pattern

Option B: Move to (0,0)
- This moves me to the top-left corner
- From (0,0), I would only have one exit: (1,0)
- This forces a very specific path continuation
- Going to a corner early could be risky as it limits options

4. DECISION:
Let me think about the overall path strategy. I've filled the right side and top-right portion. I need to cover:
- The entire left side (column 0): 6 cells
- The middle sections (columns 1-2): many cells
- The bottom sections that aren't yet visited

If I go to (0,0) now, I'm forced into (1,0), and then I'd need to snake down or across.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 19:45:00,180 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,1)
- Cells filled: 13/36
- I started at clue 1 at (5,3) and have been making my way through the board
- Looking at the board, I only see clue 1 marked. This means either there are no more clues, or I need to reach the end of the path after visiting all cells.
- Since there's only clue 1 visible, my goal is to create a Hamiltonian path that visits all 36 cells exactly once.

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to fill the remaining 23 cells without trapping myself
- Available moves from (1,1): (2,1), (1,0), (1,2)
- I need to ensure I don't create isolated regions that would be impossible to visit later

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (2,1) - going down
- This continues downward into the left side of the board
- The left side has many unvisited cells (entire columns 0-2 below row 2)
- This seems like a natural continuation to sweep through the lower-left area

Option B: Move to (1,0) - going left
- This puts me in the corner at (1,0)
- From (1,0), I would only have moves to (0,0) or (2,0), limiting flexibility
- Could potentially trap me if not carefully planned

Option C: Move to (1,2) - going right
- This moves toward the middle column
- However, I've already visited (0,2), so this would create a more complex path
- From (1,2), I'd have access to (2,2) primarily

4. DECISION:
Looking at the board structure, I need to systematically cover the remaining cells. The lower-left quadrant (rows 2-5, columns 0-2) has the most unvisited cells. Moving to (2,1) allows me to:
- Continue in a downward sweep pattern
- Maintain access to the large unvisited area in the bottom-left
- Avoid cornering myself prematurely

The best approach is to work through the left columns systematically before potentially moving back right.

- There's only one clue visible (clue 1), so I need to focus on visiting all remaining cells

2. CURRENT SITUATION:
Looking at the board, I can see my path has covered:
- The right side: column 5 from row 1-3
- Top row: columns 1-4 in row 0

3. AVAILABLE MOVES:
- (3,1) - move down
- (2,0) - move left
- (2,2) - move right

4. EVALUATION:

Option A: (2,0) - Move left to the leftmost column
- Pros: Opens up the left column (column 0), which needs to be visited
- Cons: Could potentially trap me if I go down column 0 and can't get back efficiently

- Cons: Column 2 still has many unvisited cells, might create isolated regions

Option C: (3,1) - Move down
- Pros: Continues down column 1, which has unvisited cells below
- Cons: Need to ensure I can reach all remaining cells

5. STRATEGIC THINKING:
I need to fill 22 more cells. Looking at the unvisited areas:

- Column 3: row 5 (1 cell)
- Column 4: rows 4, 5 (2 cells)
- Column 5: rows 4, 5 (2 cells)
- Plus some scattered cells

The safest strategy is to work methodically. Since I'm at (2,1), moving to (2,0) opens the entire left column. From there, I can snake down column 0, then work my way back through the remaining cells.

If I go to (2,0), I can then go down to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), then back up or across to fill the remaining cells systematically.

DECISION: Moving to (2,0) allows me to access column 0 and work through the left side of the board systematically, which seems like the most organized approach to ensure I don't trap myself.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (2,0)
   - Progress: 15/36 cells filled
   - I've already visited clue 1 at (5,3) and have been moving through the board
   - Available moves: (1,0) or (3,0) - both moving vertically from my current position

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since clue 1 was the only clue given, I need to fill all 36 cells in one continuous path
   - I need to ensure I can visit all remaining 21 cells without getting trapped
   - I need to avoid creating isolated regions that I can't reach later

3. EVALUATION:

   Looking at the board state:
   ```
     .  [12] [11] [10] [ 9]   6 
     .  [13]   .    4  [ 8] [ 7]

     .    .    .  [ 2]   .    . 
     .    .    .  [ 1]   .    . 
   ```

   Move Option 1: (1,0) - Moving UP
   - This would place me at row 1, column 0
   - From there, I could only move to (0,0) next (since (2,0) is already visited)
   - After (0,0), I'd be trapped in the top-left corner with no way to reach the remaining empty cells in the middle and bottom of the board
   - This would create a dead-end situation

   Move Option 2: (3,0) - Moving DOWN
   - This would place me at row 3, column 0
   - From there, I have multiple options to continue: (4,0) or potentially (3,1)
   - This allows me to sweep down the left side and then work across the bottom rows
   - Looking at the unvisited cells, most are in rows 1-5, columns 0-4
   - This move keeps me connected to the largest block of unvisited cells

4. DECISION:
   Moving to (3,0) is clearly the better choice. Moving to (1,0) would trap me in the corner with only one remaining cell (0,0) accessible, leaving 20 cells unreachable. Moving to (3,0) keeps my path flexible and allows me to continue filling the board systematically by working down the left column and then across the bottom portions of the board.

2025-12-10 19:45:52,889 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,0)
- Progress: 16/36 cells filled (20 cells remaining)
- I started at clue 1 at (5,3) and have been making a path
- Available moves: (4,0) down or (3,1) right

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1), I need to create a Hamiltonian path that visits all 36 cells exactly once
- I must ensure I don't trap myself or create isolated regions
- Looking at the board, I have filled the right side and top portion, now working on the left side

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (4,0) - Moving down
- This takes me to row 4, column 0
- From (4,0), I could continue to (5,0) to fill the bottom-left corner
- This would allow me to work my way across the bottom row
- After reaching (5,0), I'd need to come back up, potentially going (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> etc.

Option B: Move to (3,1) - Moving right
- This takes me into the middle-left area
- From (3,1), I could go to (4,1) or (2,1) is already filled
- This might create complications as I'd need to manage the bottom-left corner separately

Let me think about the remaining unvisited cells:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,5)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,2), (1,3)
- Row 2: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5)

If I go to (4,0):
- I can sweep the bottom: (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) is filled... wait, (1,4) is already visited
- Let me reconsider: (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,4) would skip (5,3) which is already filled
- Better: (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) then up to (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) is taken... 

Let me trace more carefully: From (4,0), going down first allows me to handle the bottom-left systematically.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,0) is better because:
- It allows me to sweep the bottom row systematically
- I can fill (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) and then work my way back up and right
- This prevents leaving the bottom-left corner isolated

- No other clues are visible on the board, so clue 1 is both the start and end point
- Since I've already visited clue 1, my goal now is to fill all remaining cells and create a complete path

**2. STRATEGY: Path Completion**
Since there's only one clue (clue 1 at position (5,3)) and I've already started from it, I need to:
- Fill all 36 cells in one continuous path
- The path will end wherever the last unfilled cell is
- Avoid creating isolated regions that cannot be reached later

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

Option A: Move to (5,0)
- Goes down to the bottom-left corner
- From (5,0), I can only move right to (5,1) or up to (4,0) - but (4,0) is already visited
- This would force me into the bottom row: (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2)
- After (5,2), I'd need to go to (5,3) but that's already visited (clue 1)
- This creates a problem! I'd be trapped in a dead-end
- **CONS: Creates a dead-end situation**

Option B: Move to (4,1)
- Stays in row 4, moving right
- Keeps more options open for maneuvering
- From (4,1), I can access (4,2), (5,1), or (3,1)
- This allows me to sweep through the middle area before dealing with the bottom corners
- I can plan a path that covers the remaining empty cells systematically
- **PROS: Maintains flexibility and avoids premature dead-ends**

**4. DECISION:**
Move to (4,1) is clearly better. Moving to (5,0) would trap me in the bottom-left corner with no way to complete the full path. By moving to (4,1), I maintain access to multiple areas of the board and can plan a sweep pattern that covers all remaining cells.

The safest strategy is to work through row 4, then handle the bottom row (row 5) last, ensuring I don't create isolated pockets.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,1)
- Progress: 18/36 cells filled, so I need to fill 18 more cells
- I started at clue 1 at position (5,3) and have been creating a path
- Looking at the board, I can see my path has covered the top-right area and left side
- Available moves: (3,1), (5,1), (4,2)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1 at start), I need to create a Hamiltonian path visiting all 36 cells
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or create unreachable cells
- Looking at unvisited cells: I need to cover the bottom-right area and middle section

3. EVALUATION OF MOVES:

Move (3,1): 
- This goes UP from (4,1) to (3,1)
- Looking at row 3: cells (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are available (though (3,3) was visited at position [3])
- This could help me access the middle area
- But I notice (3,1) is surrounded by visited cells on left (3,0) and I came from below
- This might create path issues

Move (5,1):
- This goes DOWN from (4,1) to (5,1)
- Row 5 has cells (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) unvisited (except (5,3) which was my start)
- This opens up the bottom row which I need to cover
- From (5,1), I could move to (5,0), (5,2), or back up
- This seems promising for covering the bottom area

Move (4,2):
- This goes RIGHT from (4,1) to (4,2)
- Row 4 has (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) to consider
- (4,3) was visited at position [2]
- This would let me work across row 4 and potentially connect to the right side
- From (4,2), I have flexibility to go to (3,2), (5,2), or (4,3) is already visited

4. DECISION:
Looking at the unvisited areas, I need to fill:
- Bottom row: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5)
- Middle areas: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5)
- Upper middle: (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)

Going to (5,1) allows me to sweep the bottom row first, which is a good strategy. From (5,1), I can go to (5,2), then potentially up to connect with the rest of the board. If I don't handle the bottom row now, I might get trapped later.

2025-12-10 19:46:49,010 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,1)
- Progress: 19/36 cells filled, so 17 cells remaining
- I started at clue 1 at (5,3) and have been building a path
- Available moves: (5,0) or (5,2)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1 at the start), I need to create a continuous path that visits all 36 cells
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or leave cells unreachable
- Looking at the board, I can see several empty regions that need to be filled

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (5,0)
- This would take me to the bottom-left corner
- From (5,0), I'd be in a corner with limited exit options
- Looking at the empty cells, there are several in the middle of the board that still need visiting
- If I go to (5,0), I'd likely have to come back through (5,1) since it's already visited, which is IMPOSSIBLE
- This would create a dead-end situation

Option B: Move to (5,2)
- This keeps me in the bottom row but moves toward the middle
- From (5,2), I can access (5,3) which is already visited, or (4,2) which is empty
- This allows me to move upward into the empty region in the middle of the board
- The empty cells at (4,2), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,2), (1,0), (0,0) still need to be visited
- Moving to (5,2) keeps more options open for completing the path

Looking at the remaining empty cells:
- Bottom row: (5,0), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5)
- Middle sections: (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,0), (1,2), (0,0), (0,5)

If I move to (5,0) now, I'll trap myself because I can't revisit (5,1). I MUST leave (5,0) for later when I can approach it from a different direction (like from (4,0), but (4,0) is already visited).

Wait - (4,0) is already visited (step 17), so I cannot reach (5,0) from above. This means (5,0) MUST be reached from (5,1) now, OR it will remain unreachable. But if I go to (5,0) now, I'll be stuck in a corner with no exit since (5,1) is already visited and (4,0) is already visited.

This means (5,0) must be the LAST cell I visit! I need to save it for the very end of my path.

4. DECISION:
I should move to (5,2) to keep the path open and save (5,0) for the absolute end of the puzzle.

If I move to (5,0) now, I'll trap myself because I can't revisit (5,1). I MUST leave (5,0) for later when I can approach it from a different direction (like from (4,0), but (4,0) is already visited).

Wait - (4,0) is already visited (step 17), so I cannot reach (5,0) from above. This means (5,0) MUST be reached from (5,1) now, OR it will remain unreachable. But if I go to (5,0) now, I'll be stuck in a corner with no exit since (5,1) is already visited and (4,0) is already visited.

This means (5,0) must be the LAST cell I visit! I need to save it for the very end of my path.

4. DECISION:
I should move to (5,2) to keep the path open and save (5,0) for the absolute end of the puzzle.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 19:47:03,185 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (5,2)
   - Progress: 20/36 cells filled, so I need to fill 16 more cells
   - Only one clue exists: Clue 1 at (5,3), which I've already visited as my starting point
   - Since there's only one clue and I've already started from it, I just need to create a continuous path that fills all remaining 16 empty cells
   - Available next move: (4,2) - this is the only option given

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since there's only clue 1 and I've already visited it, my goal is simply to fill all remaining empty cells without getting trapped
   - I need to ensure my path can reach all the unfilled cells in the upper right area and the bottom right area
   - Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
     * Top left corner: (0,0)
     * Top right: (0,5)
     * Middle sections: (1,0), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
     * Bottom right area: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5)

3. EVALUATION:
   - Only one move available: (4,2)
   - This move goes upward from (5,2) to (4,2)
   - From (4,2), I can potentially continue to fill the middle empty cells and then work my way to cover all remaining areas
   - This seems like a natural continuation that keeps options open

4. DECISION:
   - Move to (4,2) is the only available option and it's a good move strategically
   - From (4,2), I'll have access to (3,2) upward and (4,3) to the right (though (4,3) is already filled)
   - This allows me to continue building the path through the central empty area

2025-12-10 19:47:18,748 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,2)
- Progress: 21/36 cells filled, so 15 cells remaining
- Only one available move: (3,2)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (5,3) and need to complete the path visiting all cells

2. CURRENT SITUATION:
Looking at the visual board, I can see:
- The path has created a snake-like pattern
- I'm at (4,2) and can only move to (3,2)
- Empty cells remaining: (0,0), (1,0), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)
- That's 13 empty cells, plus I need to count current position moves

3. STRATEGY:
Since there's only one clue (clue 1) and I started there, my goal is simply to fill all remaining cells in a valid path. I need to ensure I don't trap myself and can reach all remaining empty cells.

4. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVE:
- Move to (3,2): This is the only available option
  - From (3,2), I would be able to access (2,2) or potentially (3,1)
  - This continues filling the middle section of the board
  - I need to ensure I can still reach the remaining empty cells: top-left corner area and bottom-right corner area

5. CHECKING PATH VIABILITY:
After moving to (3,2), I need to plan how to reach all remaining cells:
- From (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1)
- The top-left area (0,0), (1,0), (1,2) needs to be accessible
- The right side area (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5), (5,0) needs to be accessible
- The middle area (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) needs to be connected

The only move available is (3,2), so I must take it and plan the rest of the path carefully from there.

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,2)
- Progress: 22/36 cells filled, so I need 14 more cells to complete the puzzle
- I started at clue 1 at position (5,3) and have been tracing a path
- There's only one clue visible (clue 1), so this appears to be a puzzle where I just need to fill all cells

2. REMAINING CELLS:
Looking at the visual board, the unfilled cells (marked with '.') are:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,5)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,1)
- Row 4: (4,4), (4,5)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)

That's 13 unfilled cells, plus my current position makes 14 cells remaining to visit.

3. AVAILABLE MOVES:
From (3,2), I can move to:
- (2,2) - moves up
- (3,1) - moves left

4. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (2,2)
- This moves up into row 2
- From (2,2), I could access (1,2), (2,3)
- Row 2 has three empty cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- If I go up to (2,2), I need to consider how to cover all remaining cells

Option B: Move to (3,1)
- This moves left in row 3
- From (3,1), I could only move to (2,1) which is already filled
- This would be a dead end! I cannot move anywhere from (3,1) except back to (3,2)

5. DECISION:
Move (3,1) would create a dead end since (2,1), (4,1), and (3,0) are all already visited. I would have nowhere to go from there.

Move (2,2) is the only viable option. From there, I can continue to (1,2), then work my way through the remaining empty cells systematically.

- Row 1: (1,0), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,1)
- Row 4: (4,4), (4,5)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)

That's 13 unfilled cells, plus my current position makes 14 cells remaining to visit.

3. AVAILABLE MOVES:
From (3,2), I can move to:
- (2,2) - moves up
- (3,1) - moves left

4. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (2,2)
- This moves up into row 2
- From (2,2), I could access (1,2), (2,3)
- Row 2 has three empty cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- If I go up to (2,2), I need to consider how to cover all remaining cells

Option B: Move to (3,1)
- This moves left in row 3
- From (3,1), I could only move to (2,1) which is already filled
- This would be a dead end! I cannot move anywhere from (3,1) except back to (3,2)

5. DECISION:
Move (3,1) would create a dead end since (2,1), (4,1), and (3,0) are all already visited. I would have nowhere to go from there.

Move (2,2) is the only viable option. From there, I can continue to (1,2), then work my way through the remaining empty cells systematically.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 19:47:52,692 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,2)
- Cells filled: 23/36, so I need to fill 13 more cells
- I started at clue 1 at (5,3) and have been creating a path
- Available moves: (1,2) or (2,3)

2. REMAINING EMPTY CELLS:
Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,5)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,2), (1,3)
- Row 2: (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 4: (4,4), (4,5)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)

That's 12 empty cells + current position = 13 more moves needed.

3. EVALUATION OF MOVES:

Option A: (1,2)
- This moves up to row 1
- From (1,2), I could access (1,3) and potentially (0,0) through proper routing
- This would help me reach the top-left corner area which still has empty cells
- From (1,2), I can potentially go to (1,3) then work my way around

Option B: (2,3)
- This moves right to (2,3)
- From (2,3), I can access (2,4) which is empty
- After (2,3) -> (2,4), I'd need to find a way to connect to the remaining empty cells
- This could potentially trap me or make it harder to reach (0,0) and other corners

4. PATH PLANNING:
I need to ensure I can reach all remaining empty cells. Let me trace possible paths:

If I go to (1,2):
- (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) is blocked, so (2,4) -> down path
- Can then work around to collect remaining cells

If I go to (2,3):
- (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> then I'd need to go down or up
- Going up from (2,4) is blocked by (1,4) already visited
- Would have to go down, but this makes reaching (1,2), (1,3), (1,0), (0,0) harder

5. DECISION:
Moving to (1,2) is better because:
- It keeps my options open for reaching the top-left area
- From (1,2), I can access (1,3) and continue to (2,3), (2,4)
- It allows a more natural flow to cover all remaining empty cells
- Going to (2,3) first might trap me from efficiently reaching cells in rows 0 and 1

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 24 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
   - Current position: (1,2)
   - Cells filled: 24/36 (12 cells remaining)
   - Only one available move: (1,3)
   - I've already visited clue 1 at (5,3) and that's the only clue on the board
   - Since there's only one clue, I just need to complete a Hamiltonian path visiting all 36 cells

2. REMAINING CELLS TO VISIT:
   Looking at the visual board, the unfilled cells are:
   - (0,0), (0,5)
   - (1,0)
   - (2,3), (2,4)
   - (3,1)
   - (4,4), (4,5)
   - (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)
   
   That's 11 cells, plus my next move makes 12 remaining cells total.

3. EVALUATION OF MOVE (1,3):
   - This is the ONLY available move from (1,2)
   - Position (1,3) is currently empty and unvisited
   - From (1,3), I would be able to move to:
     * (0,3) - already visited [10]
     * (1,2) - already visited [24] (where I am now)
     * (1,4) - already visited [8]
     * (2,3) - unvisited, this would be a good continuation
   
4. PATH PLANNING:
   After moving to (1,3), I need to continue to (2,3), then likely (2,4) to fill that area, then work my way through the remaining unfilled cells. The key is to avoid creating isolated regions that can't be reached.

5. DECISION:
   Since (1,3) is the only available move, I must take it. From there, I should continue to (2,3) to access the unfilled cells in that region, ensuring I can complete the full path without trapping myself.

2025-12-10 19:48:23,108 - INFO - I am currently at position (1,3) and have filled 25 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (1,3)
   - Cells filled: 25/36 (11 cells remaining)
   - Only one clue exists (Clue 1 at position (5,3)) which I've already visited as my starting point
   - Since there's only one clue, I just need to complete a Hamiltonian path visiting all remaining 11 empty cells

2. REMAINING EMPTY CELLS:
   Looking at the visual board, the empty cells are:
   - (0,0), (0,5)
   - (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)
   - (2,3), (2,4)
   - (3,1)
   - (4,4), (4,5)
   
   That's 10 empty cells, plus my current position makes 25 filled, so 11 more moves needed.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-12-10 19:48:37,816 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,3)
- Progress: 26/36 cells filled, so 10 cells remaining
- Only one available move: (2,4)
- I started at clue 1 at (5,3) and there are no other clues visible on the board
- Looking at the board, the unfilled cells are:
  * Row 0: (0,0), (0,5)
  * Row 2: (2,4)
  * Row 3: (3,1)
  * Row 4: (4,4), (4,5)
  * Row 5: (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only clue 1 on the board and I've already visited it (started there), I just need to complete the path through all remaining cells
- I need to visit all 36 cells exactly once
- From (2,3), I can only move to (2,4) since all other adjacent cells are already visited

3. EVALUATION:
- Move to (2,4): This is the only available move from my current position
  * Pros: It's the only legal move available; it connects to (2,5) which is already visited
  * Cons: I need to ensure I can reach all remaining 9 cells after this move
  
Let me trace what happens if I go to (2,4):
- From (2,4), I would need to reach: (0,0), (0,5), (3,1), (4,4), (4,5), (5,0), (5,4), (5,5)
- From (2,4), I can move to (1,4) [already visited], (2,5) [already visited], (3,4) [already visited], or (2,3) [just came from]
- Wait, this seems problematic. Let me reconsider the available moves.

Actually, looking more carefully at position (2,3), the adjacent cells are:
- (1,3) - already visited (step 25)
- (3,3) - already visited (step 3)
- (2,2) - already visited (step 23)
- (2,4) - not yet visited

So (2,4) is indeed the only option.

4. DECISION:
Since (2,4) is the only available move and I must continue the path, I have no choice but to move there. After moving to (2,4), I'll need to carefully plan the remaining path to cover all unfilled cells.

MOVE: (2,4)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **ANALYSIS - Current Position and Status:**
   - Current position: (2,4)
   - Progress: 27/36 cells filled (9 cells remaining)
   - The puzzle states "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" but let me verify this

2. **Checking Available Moves from (2,4):**
   - Up: (1,4) - Already visited (step 8)
   - Down: (3,4) - Already visited (step 4)
   - Left: (2,3) - Already visited (step 26)
   - Right: (2,5) - Already visited (step 6)
   
   All four adjacent cells have been visited! This appears to be a dead end.

3. **Examining Unfilled Cells:**
   Looking at the board, the unfilled cells are:
   - (0,0)
   - (0,5)
   - (3,1)
   - (4,4)
   - (4,5)
   - (5,0)
   - (5,4)
   - (5,5)
   
   That's 8 unfilled cells, but we need to fill 9 more cells (36 - 27 = 9).

4. **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**
   The path has created an impossible situation. From position (2,4), all adjacent cells have already been visited, making it impossible to continue. This means the path taken has trapped itself.

5. **Why This Happened:**
   The path created isolated regions. Looking at the unfilled cells:
   - (0,0) is isolated in the top-left corner
   - (0,5) is isolated in the top-right corner
   - (3,1) is surrounded by visited cells
   - The bottom-right region (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) forms an isolated group
   - (5,0) is in the bottom-left corner

   The current path has no way to reach these cells without revisiting already-visited cells.

**CONCLUSION:**
Unfortunately, this puzzle is in an unsolvable state from the current position. The path has been constructed in a way that leaves the current position (2,4) completely surrounded by already-visited cells, with no legal moves available to continue.

This is a backtracking situation - the puzzle would need to be restarted or the path would need to be reconstructed from an earlier point to avoid creating this dead end.

MOVE: No valid move available - puzzle is stuck and requires backtracking.

2025-12-10 19:49:12,955 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (2,4)
- Cells filled: 27/36 (9 cells remaining)
- The puzzle states "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" but let me verify this.
- Looking at position (2,4), the adjacent cells are:
  - Up: (1,4) - already visited [8]
  - Down: (3,4) - already visited [4]
  - Left: (2,3) - already visited [26]
  - Right: (2,5) - already visited [6]

All adjacent cells have been visited, so I am indeed stuck at this position.

2. BACKTRACKING ANALYSIS:
Let me examine where the path went wrong. Looking at the visual board:
- Empty cells remaining: (0,0), (1,0), (3,1), (4,4), (4,5), (5,0), (5,4), (5,5) - that's 8 empty cells
- Wait, let me recount: I've filled 27 cells, so 36-27 = 9 cells should be empty

Looking at the board more carefully:
Row 0: (0,0) empty, rest filled
Row 1: (1,0) empty, rest filled  
Row 2: all filled
Row 3: (3,1) empty, rest filled
Row 4: (4,4), (4,5) empty, rest filled
Row 5: (5,0), (5,4), (5,5) empty, rest filled

That's 8 empty cells, but I should have 9 empty. Let me recount the path - it has 27 positions listed, starting from position 1 to 27.

3. THE PROBLEM:
The current path has created isolated regions. The empty cells at (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) form an isolated region in the bottom-right that cannot be reached from (2,4) without revisiting cells. Similarly, (0,0), (1,0), (3,1), and (5,0) are isolated.

This is a STUCK position - the puzzle cannot be completed from here with the current path.

CONCLUSION:
The puzzle is unsolvable from this state. The path needs to be replanned from an earlier point to avoid isolating cells. The mistake likely occurred when the path moved in a way that cut off access to the bottom-right corner (cells around (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5)).

Since I must provide a move but all adjacent cells are already visited:

MOVE: Unable to move - puzzle is in an unsolvable state. Need to backtrack and replan the path from an earlier position.

However, if I must provide coordinates despite being stuck:

2025-12-10 19:50:05,957 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (3,2)
- Path taken: (4,2) -> (3,2)
- Cells filled: 2/36
- I started at clue 1 at position (4,2)

**Understanding the Clues:**
Looking at the visual board, I can see numbered clues:
- Clue 1: (4,2) - already visited (start)
- Clue 2: (1,1)
- Clue 3: (1,0)
- Clue 4: (0,2)
- Clue 5: (3,3)
- Clue 6: (3,4)
- Clue 7: (3,5)
- Clue 8: (0,3)
- Clue 9: (0,4)
- Clue 10: (0,5)

**Next Objective:**
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (1,1).

**Available Moves Analysis:**
From (3,2), I can move to:
1. (2,2) - Moving up
2. (3,1) - Moving left
3. (3,3) - Moving right (this is clue 5)

**Evaluation:**

*Option 1: (2,2) - Moving up*
- This moves me closer to clue 2 at (1,1)
- From (2,2), I could continue toward (1,1)
- This seems like a reasonable path toward the next clue

*Option 2: (3,1) - Moving left*
- This moves me toward the left side of the board
- From (3,1), I could move to (2,1) and then to (1,1) to reach clue 2
- This also provides a path to clue 2

*Option 3: (3,3) - Moving right*
- This is clue 5! But I need to visit clue 2, 3, and 4 first
- I cannot visit clue 5 now as I must visit clues in order
- This move is NOT valid at this time

**Path Planning:**
I need to reach clue 2 at (1,1), then clue 3 at (1,0), then clue 4 at (0,2), then clue 5 at (3,3).

If I go (2,2), I can continue: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) [clue 2] -> (1,0) [clue 3] -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) [clue 4]

If I go (3,1), I can continue: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) [clue 2] -> (1,0) [clue 3] -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) [clue 4]

Both paths seem viable, but (2,2) gives me more flexibility and keeps the left column more accessible for later. Moving to (3,1) immediately commits me to using the left side of the board early.

**Decision:**
(2,2) is the better choice as it maintains more flexibility and provides a clear path to clue 2 while keeping options open for the rest of the puzzle.

2025-12-10 19:50:05,995 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 19:50:05,996 - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (3,2)
- Path taken: (4,2) -> (3,2)
- Cells filled: 2/36
- I started at clue 1 at position (4,2)

**Understanding the Clues:**
Looking at the visual board, I can see numbered clues:
- Clue 1: (4,2) - already visited (start)
- Clue 2: (1,1)
- Clue 3: (1,0)
- Clue 4: (0,2)
- Clue 5: (3,3)
- Clue 6: (3,4)
- Clue 7: (3,5)
- Clue 8: (0,3)
- Clue 9: (0,4)
- Clue 10: (0,5)

**Next Objective:**
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (1,1).

**Available Moves Analysis:**
From (3,2), I can move to:
1. (2,2) - Moving up
2. (3,1) - Moving left
3. (3,3) - Moving right (this is clue 5)

**Evaluation:**

*Option 1: (2,2) - Moving up*
- This moves me closer to clue 2 at (1,1)
- From (2,2), I could continue toward (1,1)
- This seems like a reasonable path toward the next clue

*Option 2: (3,1) - Moving left*
- This moves me toward the left side of the board
- From (3,1), I could move to (2,1) and then to (1,1) to reach clue 2
- This also provides a path to clue 2

*Option 3: (3,3) - Moving right*
- This is clue 5! But I need to visit clue 2, 3, and 4 first
- I cannot visit clue 5 now as I must visit clues in order
- This move is NOT valid at this time

**Path Planning:**
I need to reach clue 2 at (1,1), then clue 3 at (1,0), then clue 4 at (0,2), then clue 5 at (3,3).

If I go (2,2), I can continue: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) [clue 2] -> (1,0) [clue 3] -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) [clue 4]

If I go (3,1), I can continue: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) [clue 2] -> (1,0) [clue 3] -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) [clue 4]

Both paths seem viable, but (2,2) gives me more flexibility and keeps the left column more accessible for later. Moving to (3,1) immediately commits me to using the left side of the board early.

(2,2) is the better choice as it maintains more flexibility and provides a clear path to clue 2 while keeping options open for the rest of the puzzle.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,2)
- Path so far: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) - moving straight up from clue 1
- Cells filled: 3/36
- Available moves: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3)
- I've only visited clue 1 so far, so there are no other numbered clues on this board (clue 1 is the only clue)

2. STRATEGY:
Since clue 1 at (4,2) is the ONLY clue on this board, I need to:
- Create a path that visits all 36 cells exactly once
- Start from (4,2) (already done)
- End wherever makes sense after visiting all cells
- The path must be continuous without revisiting any cell

3. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

Move to (1,2):
- Continues moving up in the same column
- Would reach (1,2), then only (0,2) would be available above
- This might trap me in the upper portion too early
- From (1,2), I'd have limited options and might cut off large sections

Move to (2,1):
- Moves left, opening up the left side of the board
- From (2,1), I could access (1,1), (2,0), or (3,1)
- This gives me more flexibility to snake through the board
- Allows me to work systematically across rows

Move to (2,3):
- Moves right toward the numbered cells I see on the board (positions show numbers 4-10 in upper right)
- Wait - those numbers in the visual might be decorative or part of a different notation
- From (2,3), I could continue right or down
- Opens up the right side of the board

4. DECISION:
Looking at the board layout, I need to create a snake-like pattern to cover all 36 cells. Moving to (2,1) allows me to start building a systematic path. From there, I can move to (2,0) to reach the leftmost column, then snake back and forth across the rows. This is a classic approach for filling rectangular grids completely.

The move to (1,2) would continue upward but might strand me in a corner too quickly. The move to (2,3) heads right, but I want to secure the left side first before expanding rightward.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 19:50:56,573 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,1)
- Progress: 5/36 cells filled
- Path so far: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 (there's only clue 1 visible at (4,2), but looking at the board, I see other numbers that appear to be clues)
- Looking at the visual board, I can see clue numbers: 1 at (4,2), and other numbers on the board: 4 at (0,2), 5 at (3,3), 6 at (3,4), 7 at (3,5), 8 at (0,3), 9 at (0,4), 10 at (0,5)

Wait, let me re-read the board more carefully. The visual shows:
- Row 0: . . 4 8 9 10
- Row 1: 3 [5] . . . .
- Row 2: . [4] [3] . . .
- Row 3: . . [2] 5 6 7
- Row 4: . . [1] . . .
- Row 5: . . . . . .

So the clues are: 1 at (4,2), 3 at (1,0), 4 at (0,2), 5 at (3,3), 6 at (3,4), 7 at (3,5), 8 at (0,3), 9 at (0,4), 10 at (0,5)

But wait - I started at clue 1, so I need to visit clue 2 next. I don't see a clue 2 explicitly marked. Let me reconsider...

Actually, looking at the legend: [1],[2],etc = path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers

So [1] through [5] represent my path order (cells 1-5 of my journey), and the unmarked numbers are clues I need to visit.

Since I've only been given "Clue 1: position (4,2)" and the next clue number would be 2, but I don't see it listed, perhaps there's only clue 1? Or maybe I need to find where clue 2 would be among the numbers shown.

Looking again at the board, "3" appears at (1,0). This might be clue 2 (if clues aren't necessarily numbered sequentially). But the rules say "visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3".

Let me assume the numbers on the board (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) are the remaining clues I need to visit in order.

2. STRATEGY:
My next target should be clue 3 at position (1,0).

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2)

- (1,0): This is where clue 3 is located! This would be the direct path to my next clue.
- (0,1): Moving up would take me away from clue 3 and toward the top row, but might help set up for visiting clues 4, 8, 9, 10 later.
- (1,2): Moving right keeps me on row 1 but takes me away from clue 3.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (1,0) is clearly the best choice as it directly reaches my next required clue (clue 3).

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (1,0) and have filled 6 out of 36 cells. My path so far has been: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0). I started at clue 1 at position (4,2).

2. STRATEGY: Looking at the board, I don't see any other numbered clues mentioned besides clue 1. However, I can see numbers on the visual board:
   - Position (0,2): 4
   - Position (0,3): 8
   - Position (0,4): 9
   - Position (0,5): 10
   - Position (3,3): 5

   - Position (3,5): 7

Since I only have clue 1 listed, and the puzzle requires visiting all clues in order, I need to focus on creating a path that visits all 36 cells. The numbers on the visual board appear to be additional clues.

3. EVALUATION of available moves:
   - Move to (0,0): This would take me to the top-left corner. From there, I could potentially move right along row 0 to access the clues at (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). This seems strategic as it allows me to sweep across the top row.
   
   - Move to (2,0): This would take me down to row 2. However, this might make it harder to access the top row efficiently, and I'd need to backtrack or create a more complex path.

4. DECISION: Moving to (0,0) is the better choice because:
   - It positions me at the corner, allowing a systematic sweep
   - From (0,0), I can move right to (0,1), then continue to access the clues in the top row (4, 8, 9, 10 at positions (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5))
   - This avoids trapping myself and maintains good coverage options
   - Going to (2,0) would leave the top-left area potentially difficult to access later without revisiting cells

2025-12-10 19:51:27,607 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0) and have filled 7 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my current situation:

Current path: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0)

Looking at the board, I can see:
- I started at clue 1 at position (4,2)
- I've moved up and around to reach (0,0)
- There are additional clues visible: clue 4 at (2,2) [already visited], clue 5 at (3,3), clue 6 at (3,4), clue 7 at (3,5), clue 8 at (0,3), clue 9 at (0,4), clue 10 at (0,5)

Wait, let me re-read the board. The visual shows:
- Row 0: [7] . 4 8 9 10 - This means position (0,0) is step 7 of my path, and there are clues at (0,2)=4, (0,3)=8, (0,4)=9, (0,5)=10
- Row 3: . . [2] 5 6 7 - This means clues at (3,3)=5, (3,4)=6, (3,5)=7

Since I've only visited clue 1 so far, I need to find and visit clue 2 next. Looking at the board, I don't see a clue 2 marked explicitly, which means clue 2 must be on an empty cell that I need to reach.

Actually, looking more carefully at the legend: [1],[2],etc = path order vs 1,2,etc = clue numbers. So the [2] at position (3,2) means that's the 2nd step in my path, not clue 2.

The visible clues are: 1 at (4,2), 4 at (0,2), 5 at (3,3), 6 at (3,4), 7 at (3,5), 8 at (0,3), 9 at (0,4), 10 at (0,5).

This means I need to visit clues 2 and 3 which aren't shown yet. They must be discovered as I continue my path.

From (0,0), my only available move is (0,1). This is the only direction I can go since:
- Can't go left (out of bounds)
- Can't go up (out of bounds)  
- Can't go down to (1,0) - already visited
- Can go right to (0,1) - this is available

Since there's only one legal move and I need to continue filling the board, I must move to (0,1). This will keep me in the top row where I can eventually reach the clues at positions (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), and (0,5).

MOVE: (0,1)

2025-12-10 19:51:27,625 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 19:51:27,627 - INFO - I am currently at position (0,0) and have filled 7 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my current situation:

Current path: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0)

Looking at the board, I can see:
- I started at clue 1 at position (4,2)
- I've moved up and around to reach (0,0)
- There are additional clues visible: clue 4 at (2,2) [already visited], clue 5 at (3,3), clue 6 at (3,4), clue 7 at (3,5), clue 8 at (0,3), clue 9 at (0,4), clue 10 at (0,5)

Wait, let me re-read the board. The visual shows:
- Row 0: [7] . 4 8 9 10 - This means position (0,0) is step 7 of my path, and there are clues at (0,2)=4, (0,3)=8, (0,4)=9, (0,5)=10
- Row 3: . . [2] 5 6 7 - This means clues at (3,3)=5, (3,4)=6, (3,5)=7

Since I've only visited clue 1 so far, I need to find and visit clue 2 next. Looking at the board, I don't see a clue 2 marked explicitly, which means clue 2 must be on an empty cell that I need to reach.

Actually, looking more carefully at the legend: [1],[2],etc = path order vs 1,2,etc = clue numbers. So the [2] at position (3,2) means that's the 2nd step in my path, not clue 2.

The visible clues are: 1 at (4,2), 4 at (0,2), 5 at (3,3), 6 at (3,4), 7 at (3,5), 8 at (0,3), 9 at (0,4), 10 at (0,5).

This means I need to visit clues 2 and 3 which aren't shown yet. They must be discovered as I continue my path.

From (0,0), my only available move is (0,1). This is the only direction I can go since:
- Can't go left (out of bounds)
- Can't go up (out of bounds)  
- Can't go down to (1,0) - already visited
- Can go right to (0,1) - this is available

Since there's only one legal move and I need to continue filling the board, I must move to (0,1). This will keep me in the top row where I can eventually reach the clues at positions (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), and (0,5).

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 19:51:41,425 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 8 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:
- I've started from clue 1 at (4,2) and have moved up through the left side of the board
- My path: (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1)
- I'm currently in the top-left area of the board
- I have only one available move: (0,2)

2. CLUE ANALYSIS:
- Looking at the visual board, I can see clues displayed:
  - Row 0: positions (0,3)=8, (0,4)=9, (0,5)=10
  - Row 3: positions (3,3)=5, (3,4)=6, (3,5)=7
- Since I started at clue 1, I don't need to visit another numbered clue yet (there's no clue 2, 3, or 4 visible on the board)

3. PATH STRATEGY:
- I need to fill all 36 cells in one continuous path
- Currently at (0,1) with 28 cells remaining
- The only move available is (0,2), which continues along the top row
- This move keeps me moving toward the clues at (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself and can reach all remaining cells

4. EVALUATION OF (0,2):
- PROS: 
  - It's the only available move
  - Continues naturally along the top row
  - Keeps me on track to reach the clues in ascending order
  - Doesn't create any immediate dead ends
- CONS:
  - None, as it's the only option

5. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
- After (0,2), I'll likely continue to (0,3) to reach clue 5
- From there, I need to navigate to reach clues 6, 7, and eventually the higher numbered clues
- I must ensure I can sweep through all remaining cells without trapping myself

I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled 9 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,2)
- Path taken: Started at clue 1 at (4,2), moved up through column 2, then wrapped around the top-left corner
- Cells filled: 9/36 (27 cells remaining)
- Only one clue visible: Clue 1 at (4,2) which I've already visited
- Available moves: (1,2) or (0,3)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I only see clue 1 on the board, I need to explore and fill all 36 cells
- I must create a continuous path that visits every cell exactly once
- I should avoid creating dead ends or isolated regions that would be impossible to visit later
- From (0,2), I'm in the top row with two options: go down to (1,2) or right to (0,3)

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,2)
- This moves back down into column 2
- Would create a problem: I've already been to (2,2), so going to (1,2) would box me into just one cell
- This would be a dead end since (1,2) would only connect to (0,2) [already visited] and (2,2) [already visited]
- This is a BAD move

Option B: Move to (0,3)
- This continues along the top row to the right
- Keeps the path flowing in a logical direction
- Allows me to continue exploring the right side of the board
- From (0,3), I can continue right or go down to (1,3), maintaining flexibility
- This preserves access to the large unexplored region in the right and bottom portions of the board
- This is the GOOD move

4. DECISION:
Moving to (0,3) is clearly the correct choice. Moving to (1,2) would create an immediate dead end since that cell would be surrounded by already-visited cells and the edge of the board. Continuing right along the top row maintains path continuity and keeps all future options open.

- Available moves: (1,3) or (0,4)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1), I need to create a path that visits all 36 cells
- I'm currently at (0,3) in the top row
- I have 26 more cells to fill
- I need to ensure I don't create any isolated regions that would be impossible to reach later

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,3) - Move down
- This would take me back down into the middle of the board
- Looking at the board, if I go down now, I still have (0,4) and (0,5) unvisited in the top row
- Going down now would force me to come back up later to fill (0,4) and (0,5)
- This could create complications in path planning

Option B: Move to (0,4) - Continue right
- This continues along the top row
- After (0,4), I can reach (0,5) to complete the top row
- From (0,5), I would move down to (1,5) and can work my way through the right side of the board
- This maintains a more systematic sweep pattern
- Keeps the path more organized and reduces risk of trapping myself

4. DECISION:
Moving to (0,4) is better because:
- It completes the top row systematically
- Avoids leaving isolated cells in the top row that would be harder to reach later
- Maintains a cleaner path structure (completing rows/sections before moving to new areas)
- Reduces the risk of creating unreachable regions

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

**1. ANALYSIS: Current Situation**
- Current position: (0,4)
- Progress: 11/36 cells filled
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (4,2), moved up to (2,2), then went left and up, creating a snake-like pattern along the top-left portion of the board
- Available moves: (1,4) or (0,5)

**2. STRATEGY: Next Clue to Visit**
Looking at the board, I can see clue numbers:
- Clue 1: (4,2) - already visited (starting point)
- Clue 5: (3,3)
- Clue 6: (3,4) 
- Clue 7: (3,5)

Since I've visited clue 1, I need to reach clue 5 next at position (3,3).

**3. EVALUATION: Available Moves**

**Option A: Move to (1,4)**
- Pros: Keeps me in the middle-upper area, maintains flexibility
- Cons: Moves me down one row, but I'm still 2 rows away from clue 5 at (3,3)
- Future path considerations: From (1,4), I could continue building a path that eventually reaches down to row 3

**Option B: Move to (0,5)**
- Pros: Reaches the rightmost corner, completes the top row
- Cons: This creates a corner position with only one exit back to (0,4), which I've already visited. This would be a dead end since I can't revisit cells!
- Future path considerations: This would TRAP me - I cannot move anywhere from (0,5) without revisiting (0,4)

**4. DECISION**

Move (0,5) would create an immediate dead end since the only adjacent cell is (0,4) which I've already visited, and (1,5) would be the only way out but I haven't visited it yet - wait, let me reconsider.

Actually, from (0,5), I could move to (1,5) which is unvisited. Let me reconsider both options more carefully:

**Reconsidering (0,5):**
- From (0,5), I can move to (1,5) - this is valid and unvisited
- This would allow me to snake down the right side of the board
- This could be a good strategy to eventually reach the clues at row 3, columns 3-5

**Reconsidering (1,4):**
- From (1,4), I can move to (1,3), (1,5), or (2,4)
- More options available, more flexibility

Given that I need to eventually reach clues 5, 6, 7 which are all on row 3 in the right portion of the board, moving to (0,5) and then snaking down the right side makes strategic sense. This would let me approach the clues from above.

I am currently at position (0,5) and have filled 12 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (0,5) - top-right corner
   - Cells filled: 12/36 (24 cells remaining)
   - Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (4,2), moved up to (2,2), then left to (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), then traced along the top row from (0,0) to (0,5)
   - Next clue to visit: Clue 5 at position (3,3)

2. STRATEGY:
   - I need to visit clues in order: 5 (at 3,3), 6 (at 3,4), 7 (at 3,5)
   - All three remaining clues are in row 3
   - I need to navigate from (0,5) down to row 3 while filling all cells exactly once

3. EVALUATION:
   - Only one move available: (1,5)
   - This move goes down from the top-right corner
   - From (1,5), I can continue down the right column or move left into row 1
   - I need to be careful to create a path that can reach all remaining cells and visit clues 5, 6, 7 in order

4. DECISION:
   - Move to (1,5) is the only option
   - This keeps me in the right column, allowing me to potentially snake through the right side of the board
   - From (1,5), I'll need to plan how to efficiently cover the remaining empty cells in rows 1-5 and columns 2-5

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (1,5) and have filled 13 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (1,5)
   - Cells filled: 13/36 (23 cells remaining)
   - Path so far has covered the top row completely (row 0) and parts of rows 1-4
   - I need to find the next clue, which should be clue 5 at position (3,3)
   - Available moves: (2,5) or (1,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - Next clue to visit: Clue 5 at position (3,3)
   - I need to navigate toward (3,3) while ensuring I don't trap myself
   - I must be careful to leave a path that allows me to visit all remaining cells

3. EVALUATION:
   
   Option A: Move to (2,5)
   - This moves down along the right edge
   - From (2,5), I could continue down to eventually work my way toward clue 5
   - This keeps the right column available for maneuvering
   - Allows me to potentially snake down the right side and then work left
   
   Option B: Move to (1,4)
   - This moves left, back toward already-visited territory
   - This would be moving backward and could trap me
   - From (1,4), I'd be surrounded by visited cells on three sides
   - This would severely limit my options and likely create dead ends

4. DECISION:
   Moving to (2,5) is clearly the better choice because:
   - It continues the path downward along the right edge
   - It maintains flexibility for future moves
   - It doesn't box me in
   - It allows me to eventually reach clue 5 at (3,3) while having room to maneuver
   - Moving to (1,4) would trap me between already-visited cells

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (2,5)
- Progress: 14/36 cells filled
- I started at clue 1 at position (4,2)
- I've filled the top-right portion of the board
- Available moves: (3,5) or (2,4)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1), I need to create a path that visits all 36 cells
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or create isolated regions
- With 22 cells remaining, I need to plan carefully to cover the entire board

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (3,5)
- This moves me down along the right edge
- Continues filling the right column
- Keeps the large unexplored area (bottom-left region) accessible
- Allows me to potentially sweep through the remaining cells systematically

Option B: Move to (2,4)
- This moves me left (back toward already-visited areas)
- Could create a more complex path pattern
- Might make it harder to systematically cover the bottom portion of the board

4. DECISION:
Looking at the board layout, I need to eventually fill:
- The entire right column below my current position: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)
- All of row 3, 4, and 5 (left portions)
- Cells at (2,3), (2,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)

If I go to (3,5), I can continue down the right edge to (4,5) and (5,5), then sweep left across row 5, creating a systematic snake-like pattern. This is a safer approach that's less likely to trap me.

If I go to (2,4) now, I'd be moving into the middle area prematurely, potentially making it harder to fill the bottom-right corner later.

The move to (3,5) maintains better connectivity and allows for a more systematic completion of the puzzle.

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
I am at position (3,5) and have filled 15 out of 36 cells. This means I still need to fill 21 more cells to complete the puzzle.

Looking at my path so far, I've:
- Started at clue 1 at (4,2)
- Moved up, then around the top edge
- Come down the right side to my current position (3,5)

**2. STRATEGY - Next Clue:**
I need to visit clue 5, which is located at position (3,3).

**3. EVALUATION - Available Moves:**

**Option A: Move to (4,5)**
- This moves me DOWN and away from clue 5 at (3,3)
- Would take me to the bottom-right area
- After this, I'd need to work my way back up and left to reach clue 5
- This could create path complications in the lower-right region

**Option B: Move to (3,4)**
- This moves me LEFT toward clue 5 at (3,3)
- Gets me one step closer to the next required clue
- From (3,4), I can then move to (3,3) to reach clue 5
- This is a direct path to my next objective

**4. DECISION:**

Move to (3,4) is clearly the better choice because:
- It moves me directly toward clue 5 at (3,3)
- It maintains efficient use of the path
- From (3,4), I'll be adjacent to clue 5 and can visit it on my next move
- This doesn't waste moves or create unnecessary detours
- It keeps the bottom portion of the board open for later path construction

Moving to (4,5) would be inefficient as it takes me away from my objective and could create complications in completing the full path later.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **Current Position**: (3,4) - I'm at step 16 of 36
2. **Clues**: I only see clue 1 at (4,2) which I've already visited, and clue 5 at (3,3)
3. **Next Objective**: I need to visit clue 5 at position (3,3)

Looking at my available moves:
- (2,4) - moves up
- (4,4) - moves down  
- (3,3) - moves left (THIS IS WHERE CLUE 5 IS!)

**Evaluation of each move:**

**(3,3) - Move to clue 5:**
- PROS: This is exactly where I need to go next! Clue 5 is at (3,3), and I must visit clues in ascending order. Since I've visited clue 1, clue 5 is my next target.
- CONS: None - this is the required move to progress through the puzzle correctly.

**(2,4) - Move up:**
- PROS: Keeps some flexibility
- CONS: Moves away from clue 5, which I need to visit. This would be inefficient and could create path complications.

**(4,4) - Move down:**
- PROS: Explores the lower area
- CONS: Also moves away from clue 5. The bottom rows (4 and 5) still have many unvisited cells, but I need to hit clue 5 first before continuing.

**Decision**: The choice is clear - I must move to (3,3) to visit clue 5. This follows the fundamental rule of visiting clues in ascending order. After visiting clue 5, I'll have 20 more cells to fill (36 total - 16 already filled - 1 for clue 5 = 19 remaining empty cells to navigate).

I am currently at position (3,3) and have filled 17 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,3)
- Cells filled: 17/36 (19 cells remaining)
- Available moves: (2,3) or (4,3)
- I've completed visiting clue 1 at (4,2) and am now creating a path through the board

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the board, I need to visit all 36 cells in one continuous path. Since there's only one clue (clue 1 at the start), my goal is to create a Hamiltonian path that covers every cell without revisiting any.

Current path analysis:
- I've covered the top row (row 0) completely
- I've covered parts of rows 1, 2, 3
- Rows 4 and 5 are mostly unvisited
- The left side of the board (columns 0-1) has many unvisited cells in rows 2-5

3. EVALUATION:
Option A: Move to (2,3)
- This moves upward into row 2
- From (2,3), I could access (1,3), (1,4), (2,4) 
- However, row 2 column 3-4 area is surrounded by visited cells
- This might create issues accessing the bottom-left area of the board
- The bottom rows (4,5) would need to be accessed later, potentially creating dead ends

Option B: Move to (4,3)
- This moves downward into row 4
- Opens access to the largely unvisited bottom portion of the board (rows 4-5)
- From (4,3), I can continue through row 4 and row 5, which have many unvisited cells
- This allows me to sweep through the bottom area systematically
- I can then work my way back up to fill the remaining cells in the middle-left area

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,3) is the better choice because:
- It gives me access to the bottom two rows which are largely empty
- It prevents me from getting trapped in the upper-middle area
- It allows for a more natural flow to cover the remaining 19 cells
- The bottom area (rows 4-5) needs to be visited, and accessing it now while I have a clear path is optimal
- I can sweep through the bottom, then work back up through columns 0-1 in the middle rows

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 19:54:39,332 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,4) and have filled 19 out of 36 cells. This means I still need to fill 17 more cells to complete the puzzle.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- Current position: (4,4)
- Available moves: (5,4) and (4,5)
- Clue 1 at (4,2) has been visited (it was the start)
- No other clues are visible on the board, so I need to complete a Hamiltonian path through all remaining empty cells

Looking at the board state:
- Row 0: Completely filled (cells 7-12)
- Row 1: Cells at (1,0), (1,1), and (1,5) are filled. Empty: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)
- Row 2: Cells at (2,1), (2,2), and (2,5) are filled. Empty: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: Cells at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) are filled. Empty: (3,0), (3,1)
- Row 4: Cells at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are filled. Empty: (4,0), (4,1), (4,5)
- Row 5: All empty (6 cells)

Remaining empty cells to visit: 17 cells
- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)
- (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)
- (3,0), (3,1)
- (4,0), (4,1), (4,5)
- (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)

Now evaluating my two options:

Option 1: Move to (5,4)
- This takes me down to row 5, which is completely empty
- From (5,4), I could move to (5,3), (5,5), or back to (4,4) [but can't go back]
- This allows me to traverse row 5 and potentially work my way back up
- Row 5 has 6 empty cells that need to be visited

Option 2: Move to (4,5)
- This takes me to the right edge of row 4
- From (4,5), I could only move to (5,5) or (3,5) [but (3,5) is already visited]
- This would force me to go to (5,5) and then I'd be in the corner
- Being in corner (5,5) early could be problematic as I'd have limited options

Strategic consideration:
I need to visit all of row 5 (6 cells) and still have cells in rows 1-4 to cover. If I go to (4,5) first, I'd be forced to (5,5) and would need to snake through row 5 from right to left. However, if I go to (5,4) first, I have more flexibility in how I traverse row 5.

Looking at the remaining cells, I need to ensure I can create a continuous path. Going to (5,4) allows me to potentially move left along row 5, then come back up through the empty cells in rows 2-4 on the left side, then handle the empty cells in row 1.

1. ANALYSIS:

- Cells filled: 20/36
- Remaining cells: 16
- I started at clue 1 at (4,2) and have been creating a path
- Available moves: (5,3) or (5,5)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1) which I've already visited, my goal is to fill all 36 cells in one continuous path
- I need to ensure I can reach ALL remaining empty cells without getting trapped
- Remaining empty cells to visit:

Looking at the board layout:

Option A: Move to (5,3)
- This moves left along row 5
- From (5,3), I could continue to (5,2), (5,1), (5,0) filling the bottom row
- Then I'd need to move up to reach the remaining cells in rows 1-4
- This could work if I can snake back up properly

Option B: Move to (5,5)
- This moves right to the corner (5,5)
- From (5,5), I'd be in a corner with only one exit back to (5,4) - but I've already been there!
- This would TRAP me since I can't revisit (5,4)
- This is a DEAD END

4. DECISION:
Move (5,5) would immediately trap me in a corner with no way out since I can't revisit (5,4). This would make it impossible to complete the puzzle.

Move (5,3) is the only viable option. It allows me to continue along row 5 towards the left side, and from there I can snake upward to fill the remaining cells in the upper portions of the board.

I am currently at position (5,3) and have filled 21 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
   - Current position: (5,3)
   - Cells filled: 21/36 (15 remaining)
   - Only one clue (clue 1) was given at the start position (4,2), which I've already visited
   - Available move: (5,2) - only one option

2. CURRENT SITUATION:
   Looking at the board, I need to fill the remaining 15 empty cells:
   - Row 1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) - 3 cells
   - Row 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) - 3 cells
   - Row 3: (3,0), (3,1) - 2 cells
   - Row 4: (4,0), (4,1), (4,5) - 3 cells
   - Row 5: (5,0), (5,1), (5,5) - 3 cells
   - Plus my current move to (5,2) - 1 cell
   Total: 15 cells remaining

3. STRATEGY:
   Since there's only clue 1 and I've already visited it, I just need to complete a path that visits all remaining cells without getting trapped. With only one available move (5,2), I must take it and plan the subsequent path carefully.

4. EVALUATION:
   Move to (5,2): This is my only option. From (5,2), I'll be able to move to:
   - (5,1) - continuing left along row 5
   - (4,2) - but this is already visited (clue 1)
   
   Moving to (5,2) and then (5,1) would allow me to continue along the bottom row, then potentially work my way up to fill the remaining cells in a systematic manner.

5. PATH PLANNING:
   After (5,2), I should go to (5,1), then (5,0), then work my way up the left column and sweep through the remaining empty cells in the middle of the board.

I am currently at position (5,2) and have filled 22 out of 36 cells. This means I need to fill 14 more cells to complete the puzzle. Looking at the board, I only have clue 1 at position (4,2), which I've already visited as my starting point. Since there are no more clues to visit, I just need to create a path that visits all remaining empty cells exactly once.

2. CURRENT SITUATION:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,1)
- Progress: 23/36 cells filled, so 13 cells remaining
- I've visited clue 1 at (4,2) and have been making a path
- Available moves: (4,1) or (5,0)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1) which I've already visited, I need to complete a Hamiltonian path visiting all 36 cells
- I need to fill the remaining 13 empty cells
- Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
  - (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) - 3 cells in row 1
  - (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) - 3 cells in row 2
  - (3,0), (3,1) - 2 cells in row 3
  - (4,0), (4,1), (4,5) - 3 cells in row 4
  - (5,0), (5,5) - 2 cells in row 5

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (4,1)
- This would go upward to row 4
- From (4,1), I could access (4,0) to the left or (3,1) upward
- This allows me to complete the bottom-left corner cells: (4,0), (4,1), (3,0), (3,1)
- After visiting these, I'd need to navigate back up to fill the remaining cells in rows 1-2

Option B: Move to (5,0)
- This would go to the bottom-left corner
- From (5,0), I can only move to (4,0) upward (since left and down are out of bounds, and right goes back to visited (5,1))
- This seems to box me into the corner too early
- I'd then need to go (4,0) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0), but (3,0) would be a dead-end with nowhere to go except back

Let me trace Option A more carefully:
- (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) - this completes bottom-left
- From (3,1), I could go to (2,1)? No, (2,1) is already visited (step 4)
- I'm stuck! This doesn't work.

Let me reconsider Option B:
- (5,1) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1) - fills bottom-left area
- From (4,1), I could go to (3,1) 
- From (3,1) to (3,0)
- From (3,0) to (2,0)
- From (2,0), I can go to (1,0)? No, already visited
- I could go from (2,0) to (2,1)? No, already visited

Wait, let me reconsider the whole remaining path more carefully. I need to connect to the unvisited upper areas.

Looking more carefully at unvisited cells and their connectivity:
- Row 1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are unvisited
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) are unvisited
- These upper cells need to be connected to my current path

From (4,1), I could eventually work my way to (2,0) via (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0), then connect to the upper unvisited cells.

From (5,0), the path would be (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (4,1), then same as above.

Given that both eventually lead to similar paths, (4,1) is better because it keeps (5,0) as a potential endpoint, and I can visit (5,0) and (4,0) later if needed.

4. DECISION:
Move to (4,1) as it provides better flexibility for completing the remaining cells and doesn't immediately corner me.

2025-12-10 19:56:56,945 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,4)
- Cells filled: 2/36
- Path so far: (1,4) -> (2,4)
- I started at clue 1 at position (1,4)
- Available moves: (3,4), (2,3), (2,5)

Looking at the board, I can see the following clues:
- Clue 1: (1,4) - already visited (starting point)
- Clue 2: (4,3)
- Clue 3: (4,0)
- Clue 4: (3,2)
- Clue 5: (2,2)
- Clue 6: (1,3)

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've started at clue 1, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (4,3). I'm currently at (2,4), so I need to plan a path that will eventually reach (4,3).

3. EVALUATION:
Let me consider each available move:

- **(3,4)**: This moves down, closer to clue 2 at (4,3). From (3,4), I could continue down to (4,4) and then left to (4,3) to reach clue 2. This seems like a direct approach.

- **(2,3)**: This moves left. This could be useful to visit clue 6 at (1,3), but I need to visit clue 2 next, not clue 6. Going left now might create a longer path to clue 2.

- **(2,5)**: This moves right to the edge of the board. This takes me away from clue 2 and toward the corner. While I need to fill all cells eventually, this doesn't seem strategically optimal right now as it moves away from my next target.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (3,4) is the best choice because:
- It moves me closer to clue 2 at (4,3)
- It maintains flexibility for future moves
- It doesn't trap me in a corner
- From (3,4), I can continue to (4,4) and then reach clue 2 at (4,3)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,3)
- Cells filled: 4/36
- Path so far: (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3)
- I started at clue 1 at position (1,4)
- I can see other clues on the board:
  - Clue 2 at position (4,3)
  - Clue 3 at position (4,0)
  - Clue 4 at position (3,2)
  - Clue 5 at position (2,2)
  - Clue 6 at position (1,3)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've only visited clue 1 so far, I need to head toward clue 2 next
- Clue 2 is at position (4,3)
- From my current position (3,3), I need to plan a path that visits clue 2

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (3,3):
- (2,3): Moving up - This would take me toward clue 6 at (1,3), but I need to visit clue 2 next, not clue 6. However, I need to be careful not to trap myself.
- (4,3): Moving down - This is exactly where clue 2 is located! This is the direct path to the next required clue.
- (3,2): Moving left - This is where clue 4 is located, but I need to visit clue 2 before clue 4. This would skip clue 2.

4. DECISION:
The clear choice is (4,3) because:
- It's the location of clue 2, which is the next clue I must visit in sequence
- Following the rule that I must visit clues in ascending order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...)
- This move directly continues my path toward completing the puzzle requirements
- After reaching clue 2, I'll need to plan my path to visit clue 3 at (4,0), then clue 4 at (3,2), then clue 5 at (2,2), and finally clue 6 at (1,3)

2025-12-10 19:58:06,731 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (4,2)
- Cells filled: 6/36
- Only one clue visible: Clue 1 at (1,4), which I've already visited as my starting point
- Path so far: (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2)

**Available Moves:** (3,2), (5,2), (4,1)

**Key Observations:**
1. I've started from clue 1 at (1,4) and have been moving in a snake-like pattern
2. I need to fill all 36 cells in one continuous path
3. Since only clue 1 is shown and I'm at position 6/36, I need to plan a path that covers all remaining cells efficiently
4. I must avoid creating isolated regions that would be impossible to visit later

**Evaluating Each Move:**

**(3,2) - Moving Up:**
- This would take me back toward row 3, column 2
- I've already visited (3,3) and (3,4), so moving to (3,2) continues along row 3
- This could set up a pattern to snake through the upper portion of the board
- Pros: Allows me to work systematically through row 3, then potentially row 2
- Cons: Need to ensure I don't trap myself in the upper region

**(5,2) - Moving Down:**
- This takes me to row 5, continuing down column 2
- I came from (4,3) to (4,2), and this continues downward
- Pros: Opens up the bottom region of the board
- Cons: Moving down now might make it harder to efficiently cover the upper-left region later

**(4,1) - Moving Left:**
- This moves me one cell to the left along row 4
- I already have (4,3) and (4,2) filled in row 4
- Pros: Continues filling row 4 from right to left
- Cons: After (4,1), I'd have (4,0) as the only option to continue left, potentially boxing me in

**Strategic Analysis:**
Given that I need to fill all 36 cells, I should think about creating an efficient snake pattern. Looking at my current path, I've been moving generally downward and leftward. 

The most efficient approach would be to:
1. Continue building a snake pattern
2. Work through one section methodically before moving to another
3. Avoid creating unreachable pockets

Moving to (5,2) allows me to go down to row 5, then I could move left along row 5 to (5,1) and (5,0), then snake back up. This creates a clean pattern and ensures I can systematically cover the board.

Moving to (4,1) would continue row 4, but then I'd be forced to (4,0), and from there my options become more constrained.

Moving to (3,2) would take me back up, but I've already partially filled row 3, which could create complexity.

**Decision:**
(5,2) is the best move because it allows me to efficiently work through the bottom row (row 5) and then snake back up systematically, maintaining good coverage options for the entire board.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 19:58:24,921 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- Current position: (5,2)
- Progress: 7/36 cells filled
- Path so far: (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (5,2)
- Only clue visible is clue 1 at (1,4), which I started from
- Available moves: (5,1) or (5,3)

**2. STRATEGY - What's Next:**
Since I only see clue 1 on the board and I've already visited it, I need to focus on creating a path that visits all 36 cells. With no other numbered clues visible, my strategy should be to:
- Avoid creating isolated regions that I can't reach later
- Maintain flexibility to cover the entire board
- Think about efficient path coverage patterns

**3. EVALUATION - Available Moves:**

Looking at the current board state:
```
  .    .    .    .    .    . 
  .    .    .    6    1    . 
  .    .    5    .    2    . 
  .    .    4    4    3    . 
  3    .    6    5    .    . 
  .    .    7    .    .    . 
```

**Option A: Move to (5,1) - LEFT**
- This continues along the bottom row going left
- From (5,1), I could continue to (5,0) to reach the corner
- This would allow me to potentially sweep up the left side of the board
- Pros: Reaches the corner, allows systematic coverage
- Cons: Need to ensure I don't trap myself

**Option B: Move to (5,3) - RIGHT**
- This moves right along the bottom row
- From (5,3), I could continue to (5,4) and (5,5)
- This would complete the bottom row to the right
- Pros: Covers the bottom-right area
- Cons: The right side already has my starting path, might create complications

**4. DECISION:**

Looking at the overall board layout, I notice that my path has primarily been on the right side (columns 3-4). The left side of the board (columns 0-2) is largely unexplored except for my current position.

Moving to (5,1) makes more strategic sense because:
1. It moves toward the unexplored left portion of the board
2. From (5,1), I can reach (5,0) and then systematically work my way up the left side
3. This creates a more balanced exploration pattern
4. It avoids potential conflicts with the already-traveled right side

The optimal strategy appears to be sweeping the bottom row to the left, then moving up the left side of the board, which will allow me to eventually snake back through the middle and top portions.

- Clues visible: 1 at (1,4) [visited], 3 at (4,0), 4 at (3,2), 5 at (2,2), 6 at (1,3)
- Available moves: (4,1) or (5,0)

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the board, I need to understand the clue sequence. I've visited clue 1. The next clues appear to be:
- Clue 3 at position (4,0)
- Clue 4 at position (3,2)
- Clue 5 at position (2,2)
- Clue 6 at position (1,3)

Wait, I need to find clue 2. Looking at the visual board, I don't see a "2" marked as a clue. Let me re-examine... The path shows I went from [1] to [2] to [3], etc., but those are my path order, not clue numbers. The actual clues shown are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.

This means clue 2 must be somewhere I haven't identified yet, or perhaps there is no clue 2 and I need to find clue 3 next at (4,0).

3. EVALUATION:
From (5,1), my options are:
- (4,1): This moves up one row, getting me closer to the upper part of the board
- (5,0): This moves left, and would put me adjacent to clue 3 at (4,0)

Since I need to visit clue 3 next (at position 4,0), I should consider which move allows me to reach it while maintaining the ability to complete the full path.

If I go to (5,0), I would be directly below clue 3 at (4,0). From (5,0), I could move to (4,0) to visit clue 3.

If I go to (4,1), I would be diagonal to clue 3. From (4,1), I would need to navigate to (4,0).

4. DECISION:
Moving to (5,0) is the better choice because:
- It positions me directly adjacent to clue 3 at (4,0)
- It allows me to visit clue 3 on the next move
- It continues filling the bottom-left corner of the board systematically
- It doesn't create any obvious dead ends or trapped regions

   - Looking at the visual board, I can see there are clue numbers marked: 6, 5, 4, 3
   - Clue 1 was at (1,4) - already visited (step 1 of path)
   - I need to identify where other clues are and visit them in order
   - From the board:
     - There's a "6" at position (1,3)
     - There's a "5" at position (2,2)
     - There's a "4" at position (3,3)
     - There's a "3" at position (4,0)

3. NEXT CLUE TO VISIT:
   - Since I started at clue 1, I should be looking for clue 2 next
   - However, I don't see a clue 2 marked on the board explicitly
   - Wait, let me reconsider - the visual shows my path positions [1] through [9], and separate clue numbers
   - Looking more carefully: clue numbers are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
   - It appears clue 2 might not be visible or I need to find the pattern

4. AVAILABLE MOVE EVALUATION:
   - Only option: (4,0)
   - This position shows "3" on the board, which is clue 3
   - But I should visit clue 2 before clue 3
   - However, I don't see clue 2 marked anywhere visible

5. RE-EXAMINING THE BOARD:
   - Let me trace what clues are where based on the visual
   - Position (4,0) has "3" - this is clue 3
   - Since I only have one move available and I'm in a corner, I must take it
   - Perhaps clue 2 was already on my path, or the puzzle allows me to proceed to clue 3

6. DECISION:
   - I have no choice but to move to (4,0)
   - This will put me at clue 3
   - After this, I'll need to navigate to clues 4, 5, and 6 in order
   - From (4,0), I'll need to plan a path that visits clue 4 at (3,3), clue 5 at (2,2), and clue 6 at (1,3)

MOVE: (4,0)

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (4,0) and have filled 10 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (4,0)
- Cells filled: 10/36 (26 more cells to fill)
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (1,4), made a winding path down and to the left
- Available moves: (3,0) going up, or (4,1) going right
- I can see clue number 6 at position (1,3) which I haven't visited yet (I'm still at path position 10)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one clue visible (clue 1 at start), I need to create a path that visits all 36 cells
- I need to be careful not to create isolated regions that would prevent me from visiting all cells
- Looking at the board, I have significant empty space in the upper left area (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) and the right side (column 5)

3. EVALUATION:
- Move (3,0): Going up to (3,0)
  PROS: This would continue upward into the left column, allowing me to potentially sweep through the upper-left area
  CONS: I need to ensure I can still access all remaining cells. Going up might start boxing me into the left side too early
  
- Move (4,1): Going right to (4,1)
  PROS: This would give me access to the middle area and potentially allow better flow through the board
  CONS: Going right might make it harder to access the left column cells efficiently later

Looking at the board more carefully:
- The upper-left region (rows 0-3, columns 0-2) is completely empty
- The right side (column 5) is completely empty
- I need to ensure I can sweep through all these areas

If I go to (3,0), I can continue up the left column to (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), then sweep right across row 0, which would be efficient for covering the top area.

If I go to (4,1), I'm moving into already somewhat populated middle area and might create awkward path constraints.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (3,0) is better because:
- It allows me to sweep up the left column efficiently
- From (3,0), I can go to (2,0), then (1,0), then (0,0), giving me access to the entire top row
- This creates a more natural flow for covering all remaining cells
- It avoids creating isolated pockets that would be hard to reach later

2025-12-10 19:59:49,553 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 12 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,0)
- Cells filled: 12/36 (24 cells remaining)
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (1,4), moved through various cells, now at (2,0)
- Available moves: (1,0) or (2,1)
- Only one clue visible on the board: clue 1 at (1,4), which I've already visited

2. STRATEGY:
Since I only see clue 1 on the board and I've already visited it, I need to explore the board to find clue 2 and subsequent clues. My goal is to:
- Continue filling cells efficiently
- Avoid creating isolated sections that would prevent me from visiting all 36 cells
- Keep my options open for future moves

3. EVALUATION:
Let me examine both available moves:

Option A: (1,0)
- This moves me up one row
- Would place me in the top-left area of the board
- Looking at the board, row 0 is completely empty
- From (1,0), I could access (0,0) and explore the entire top row
- This could help me sweep through the unexplored upper portion of the board

Option B: (2,1)
- This moves me right one column
- Keeps me in the middle-left area
- From (2,1), I could move to (1,1) or (3,1), or continue to (2,2)
- However, (2,2) area seems more constrained given my existing path

Looking at my path pattern, I've created a snake from the starting point down and around the bottom-left corner. The entire top portion of the board (row 0 and most of row 1) is unexplored. Moving to (1,0) would allow me to efficiently sweep through the top of the board.

4. DECISION:
Move to (1,0) is the better choice because:
- It gives me access to the entire unexplored top row (row 0)
- It allows for a natural continuation pattern (I can sweep right across row 0, then work my way back)

2025-12-10 19:59:49,568 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 19:59:49,568 - INFO - I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 12 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,0)
- Cells filled: 12/36 (24 cells remaining)
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (1,4), moved through various cells, now at (2,0)
- Available moves: (1,0) or (2,1)
- Only one clue visible on the board: clue 1 at (1,4), which I've already visited

2. STRATEGY:
Since I only see clue 1 on the board and I've already visited it, I need to explore the board to find clue 2 and subsequent clues. My goal is to:
- Continue filling cells efficiently
- Avoid creating isolated sections that would prevent me from visiting all 36 cells
- Keep my options open for future moves

3. EVALUATION:
Let me examine both available moves:

Option A: (1,0)
- This moves me up one row
- Would place me in the top-left area of the board
- Looking at the board, row 0 is completely empty
- From (1,0), I could access (0,0) and explore the entire top row
- This could help me sweep through the unexplored upper portion of the board

Option B: (2,1)
- This moves me right one column
- Keeps me in the middle-left area
- From (2,1), I could move to (1,1) or (3,1), or continue to (2,2)
- However, (2,2) area seems more constrained given my existing path

Looking at my path pattern, I've created a snake from the starting point down and around the bottom-left corner. The entire top portion of the board (row 0 and most of row 1) is unexplored. Moving to (1,0) would allow me to efficiently sweep through the top of the board.

4. DECISION:
Move to (1,0) is the better choice because:
- It gives me access to the entire unexplored top row (row 0)
- It allows for a natural continuation pattern (I can sweep right across row 0, then work my way back)
- It avoids trapping myself in the middle of the board
- From (1,0), I can access 6 cells in row 0, which is a significant unexplored area
- This maintains flexibility for completing the entire 36-cell path

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (1,0)
   - Progress: 13/36 cells filled
   - I've visited clue 1 at (1,4) and am working through the board
   - Available moves: (0,0) or (1,1)
   - The only clue visible is clue 1 at (1,4), which I've already visited
   - I need to continue filling the remaining 23 cells in a valid path

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since there's only one clue (clue 1), my goal is to create a continuous path that fills all 36 cells
   - I need to ensure I don't trap myself or create isolated regions
   - Looking at the board, I have significant areas unfilled: rows 0, and the right side of the board
   - From (1,0), I can go to (0,0) or (1,1)

3. EVALUATION:

   Option A: Move to (0,0)
   - Pros: 
     * Starts filling row 0 from the corner
     * Creates a natural path along the top edge
     * Leaves (1,1) available for later connection
   - Cons:
     * Could potentially box me into the corner if not careful
     * Need to ensure I can return to fill the middle areas

   Option B: Move to (1,1)
   - Pros:
     * Stays in the middle rows, maintaining flexibility
     * Allows me to potentially move up to row 0 later
   - Cons:
     * If I go to (1,1), I might need to come back to (0,0) later, which could create awkward path constraints
     * The right side of the board (columns 4-5) still needs extensive coverage

4. DECISION:
   Moving to (0,0) is the better choice. Since I'm at the edge of the board at (1,0), going to the corner (0,0) allows me to start a systematic sweep of row 0. This follows a common puzzle-solving pattern of working along edges. If I move to (1,1) now, I'll likely need to return to fill (0,0) later, which could create more complex path constraints. By going to (0,0) now, I can sweep across row 0 and then work my way back through the unfilled areas of the board.

2025-12-10 20:00:20,366 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0) and have filled 14 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:
   - I'm at (0,0) in the top-left corner
   - I've visited clue 1 at (1,4) and have been working my way around
   - Only one available move: (0,1)
   - 22 cells remaining to fill

2. PATH ANALYSIS:
   Looking at the board, I can see:
   - Row 0: Only (0,0) is filled, positions (0,1) through (0,5) are empty
   - My path has created a snake pattern starting from (1,4), going down and around the left side
   - I need to continue filling all remaining cells

3. AVAILABLE MOVE EVALUATION:
   - Only option is (0,1) - moving right from (0,0)
   - This is the natural continuation along row 0
   - From (0,1), I could continue right along row 0 or potentially move down to (1,1)

4. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
   - With only one move available, I must take (0,1)
   - This continues the path along the top row
   - I need to ensure I can eventually reach all remaining empty cells
   - Looking at the unfilled areas: top row (0,1-0,5), most of row 1 except (1,0) and (1,4), parts of rows 2-5
   - The logical approach is to continue along row 0, then snake back through the middle sections

5. FUTURE PATH PLANNING:
   - After moving to (0,1), I should continue right along row 0
   - This will allow me to fill the top row completely
   - Then I can work my way back down through the remaining empty cells in the middle and right portions of the board

Since there's only one available move, the decision is straightforward.

2025-12-10 20:00:37,338 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,1)
- Progress: 15/36 cells filled
- I started at clue 1 at position (1,4)
- Looking at the board, there's a clue "6" visible at position (4,2) which I need to reach eventually
- My path has traced from the starting position down and around the left side, and I'm now at the top-left area

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to continue filling all 36 cells in one continuous path
- Since there's only one clue (clue 1) mentioned in the clue locations, and I see a "6" on the board at (4,2), I need to ensure I can visit all cells
- I have 21 more cells to fill (36 - 15 = 21)
- I need to be strategic to avoid trapping myself

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This moves down to row 1
- From (1,1), I could continue exploring the middle area of the board
- This keeps options open for the right side of the board
- Potential path: could go to (1,2), then continue right eventually

Option B: Move to (0,2)
- This moves right along the top row
- From (0,2), I would continue along (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (0,5)
- This would fill the top row but might limit flexibility later
- After reaching (0,5), I'd need to come down the right side

Looking at the board structure:
- The right side of the board (columns 4-5) is mostly unexplored except for the starting area
- I need to make sure I can sweep through the entire middle and right sections
- If I go to (0,2), I can fill the top row completely, then come down the right side, and work through the middle areas systematically

The top row approach (0,2) seems better because:
- It completes the top boundary
- Allows me to sweep down the right side
- Then I can fill the middle section methodically
- Less risk of creating isolated pockets

4. DECISION:
Moving to (0,2) allows me to complete the top row and maintain a systematic sweep pattern. This reduces the risk of creating unreachable cells in the middle of the board.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 20:01:00,075 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **ANALYSIS**: 
   - Current position: (0,2)
   - Progress: 16/36 cells filled
   - I started at clue 1 at (1,4) and have been creating a path
   - Looking at the board, I can see clue numbers: 1 at (1,4), and other clues at various positions
   - From the visual board, I can identify clues: 1 at (1,4), clue 4 at (3,3), clue 5 at (4,3), clue 6 at (4,2)
   - Wait, let me reread the visual more carefully:
     - Position (1,3) shows "6" (clue 6)
     - Position (1,4) shows "[1]" (clue 1, already visited as step 1)
     - Position (2,4) shows "[2]" (visited as step 2)
     - Position (3,4) shows "[3]" (visited as step 3)
     - Position (3,3) shows "[4]" (visited as step 4)
     - Position (2,2) shows "5" (clue 5, not yet visited)
     - Position (4,2) shows "[6]" (visited as step 6)
     - Position (4,3) shows "[5]" (visited as step 5)

   Actually, I need to reconsider. The legend shows bracketed numbers are MY path order, and non-bracketed numbers are clue numbers. So:
   - Clue 6 is at position (1,3)
   - Clue 5 is at position (2,2)
   - Clue 4 is at position (3,3)

2. **STRATEGY**:
   - Since there's only clue 1 mentioned in the clue locations, all other numbers on the board must be additional clues
   - Looking at the visible clues: I see "6" at (1,3), "5" at (2,2), and "4" at (3,3)
   - But wait, I've already visited (3,3) as step 4 of my path. Let me re-examine...
   - The path shows I've visited these 16 cells in order
   - I need to figure out which clue to visit next
   - Given the puzzle only mentions clue 1, perhaps this is a simpler puzzle where I just need to fill all cells

3. **EVALUATION**:
   Available moves from (0,2):
   - **(1,2)**: This would move me down. Looking at the board, (1,2) is empty. This keeps me in the left portion of the board.
   - **(0,3)**: This would move me right. Position (0,3) is empty. This moves me toward the right side of the board where there are many unfilled cells.

   Let me think about coverage:
   - I've filled the left column entirely (column 0)
   - I've filled positions in row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)
   - I need to eventually cover the entire right side: columns 3, 4, 5 in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Moving to (0,3) would start filling the top row toward the right
   - Moving to (1,2) would go back down but (1,2) is an interior cell that I might want to save for later

   If I go to (0,3), I can continue along row 0 to (0,4) and (0,5), then work my way down the right side.
   If I go to (1,2), I'd be in the middle and might create path complications later.

4. **DECISION**:
   Moving to (0,3) makes more sense strategically because:
   - It allows me to continue filling the top row completely
   - It maintains a systematic approach (finishing row 0 before moving deeper)
   - It keeps my options open for filling the remaining cells in a logical pattern

2025-12-10 20:01:17,966 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze my current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,3)
- Path progress: 17/36 cells filled
- I started at clue 1 at position (1,4) and have been making a path
- Looking at the board, I can see clue numbers marked: clue 1 at (1,4) which I've already visited
- I need to identify what clue I should visit next and plan accordingly

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I started at clue 1, I need to visit clues in ascending order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...)
- From the visual board, I can see the clues marked on the board. Let me identify them:
  - Position (1,4) has [1] - already visited as my starting point
  - I need to look for clue 2, 3, 4, etc.
- Looking at the legend, the bracketed numbers show my path order, not clue numbers
- The puzzle states there's only clue 1 shown in the clue locations
- This means I only need to start at clue 1 and create a continuous path visiting all 36 cells

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (0,3):
- (1,3): This would move me down to row 1
- (0,4): This would move me right to column 4

Let me consider the implications:
- I have 19 more cells to fill (36 - 17 = 19)
- Looking at the unfilled cells on the board:
  - Row 0: positions (0,4) and (0,5) are empty
  - Row 1: positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5) are empty
  - Row 2: positions (2,1), (2,3), (2,5) are empty
  - Row 3: positions (3,1), (3,5) are empty
  - Row 4: positions (4,4), (4,5) are empty
  - Row 5: positions (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) are empty

If I move to (0,4):
- I continue along row 0 to the right
- I can then go to (0,5) and have completed the top row
- From (0,5), I can go down to (1,5) and work my way through the remaining cells
- This seems like a natural continuation

If I move to (1,3):
- I would go down and potentially box myself in
- I'd have cells (0,4) and (0,5) isolated at the top
- This could make it difficult to complete the path without revisiting cells

4. DECISION:
Moving to (0,4) is the better choice because:
- It continues filling the top row systematically
- It doesn't leave isolated cells that would be hard to reach later
- From (0,4), I can naturally flow to (0,5), then down column 5, and snake through the remaining empty cells

2025-12-10 20:01:17,987 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 20:01:17,987 - INFO - Let me analyze my current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,3)
- Path progress: 17/36 cells filled
- I started at clue 1 at position (1,4) and have been making a path
- Looking at the board, I can see clue numbers marked: clue 1 at (1,4) which I've already visited
- I need to identify what clue I should visit next and plan accordingly

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I started at clue 1, I need to visit clues in ascending order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...)
- From the visual board, I can see the clues marked on the board. Let me identify them:
  - Position (1,4) has [1] - already visited as my starting point
  - I need to look for clue 2, 3, 4, etc.
- Looking at the legend, the bracketed numbers show my path order, not clue numbers
- The puzzle states there's only clue 1 shown in the clue locations
- This means I only need to start at clue 1 and create a continuous path visiting all 36 cells

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (0,3):
- (1,3): This would move me down to row 1
- (0,4): This would move me right to column 4

Let me consider the implications:
- I have 19 more cells to fill (36 - 17 = 19)
- Looking at the unfilled cells on the board:
  - Row 0: positions (0,4) and (0,5) are empty
  - Row 1: positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5) are empty
  - Row 2: positions (2,1), (2,3), (2,5) are empty
  - Row 3: positions (3,1), (3,5) are empty
  - Row 4: positions (4,4), (4,5) are empty
  - Row 5: positions (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) are empty

If I move to (0,4):
- I continue along row 0 to the right
- I can then go to (0,5) and have completed the top row
- From (0,5), I can go down to (1,5) and work my way through the remaining cells
- This seems like a natural continuation

If I move to (1,3):
- I would go down and potentially box myself in
- I'd have cells (0,4) and (0,5) isolated at the top
- This could make it difficult to complete the path without revisiting cells

4. DECISION:
Moving to (0,4) is the better choice because:
- It continues filling the top row systematically
- It doesn't leave isolated cells that would be hard to reach later
- From (0,4), I can naturally flow to (0,5), then down column 5, and snake through the remaining empty cells
- This maintains connectivity and prevents creating unreachable regions

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:01:30,223 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,4) and have filled 18 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (0,4)
   - Cells filled: 18/36 (exactly half)
   - Only available move: (0,5)
   - The path has been going in a snake-like pattern, filling the left side and bottom of the board
   - I haven't visited any numbered clues yet besides clue 1 at (1,4) which was my starting point

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since I only have one available move (0,5), I must take it
   - Looking at the board, I need to continue filling the remaining 18 cells
   - The unfilled cells are in the right portion and some middle areas of the board
   - After moving to (0,5), I'll need to work my way down and eventually cover all remaining cells

3. EVALUATION:
   - Move to (0,5): This is the only available move
     PROS: 
     - Continues the path
     - Reaches the top-right corner
     - Allows me to continue down the right side
     CONS: 
     - None, as it's the only option
     
4. DECISION:
   - I must move to (0,5) as it's the only available move
   - From (0,5), I'll be able to move down to (1,5), which will allow me to continue filling the right side of the board
   - This keeps the path continuous and doesn't create any dead ends

The move (0,5) is necessary and logical as it's the only available option and maintains path continuity.

I am currently at position (0,5) and have filled 19 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (0,5) - top right corner
- Cells filled: 19/36, so I have 17 more cells to fill
- Only one available move: (1,5)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (1,4) and need to ensure I can reach any remaining clues

2. CLUE ANALYSIS:
Looking at the visual board, I can see clue numbers on the board:
- Clue 1: at (1,4) - already visited (this was my starting point)
- Clue 4: at (3,3) - already visited (position [4] in my path)
- Clue 5: at (4,3) - already visited (position [5] in my path)
- Clue 6: at (4,2) - already visited (position [6] in my path)

I notice there are other numbered clues visible:
- Position (1,3) shows "6" - this appears to be a clue
- Position (2,2) shows "5" - this appears to be a clue
- Position (3,2) shows "4" - this appears to be a clue

Wait, let me re-read the board more carefully. The visual shows clues that I haven't visited yet in the empty cells marked with numbers.

3. STRATEGY:
Since I only have one available move (1,5), I must take it. This move will allow me to continue exploring the right side of the board, which still has many unvisited cells.

4. EVALUATION:
- Move to (1,5): This is my only option. It keeps me on the right edge and allows me to potentially sweep down the right column (column 5) or move left into the unvisited middle area.

5. FUTURE CONSIDERATION:
After moving to (1,5), I'll need to carefully plan to:
- Cover all remaining empty cells in the middle-right area
- Ensure I don't trap myself in any dead ends
- The unvisited cells are mainly in rows 1-5, columns 1-5 (excluding already visited cells)

I am currently at position (1,5) and have filled 20 out of 36 cells. This means I have 16 cells remaining to fill.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- I'm at (1,5) in the top-right area
- The only available move is (2,5)
- I only have one clue (clue 1) which I've already visited at the start
- Since there are no more numbered clues to visit, I need to create a path that fills all remaining empty cells

Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) in row 1
- (2,1), (2,3), (2,5) in row 2
- (2,2), (3,5) in rows 2-3
- (3,1), (3,5) in row 3
- (4,1), (4,4), (4,5) in row 4
- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) in row 5

From (1,5), my only available move is (2,5) since:
- (0,5) is already visited (position 19)
- (1,4) is already visited (position 1, the starting clue)
- (2,5) is the only unvisited adjacent cell

After moving to (2,5), I need to ensure I can reach all remaining empty cells without getting trapped. The critical areas to watch are:

2025-12-10 20:01:59,700 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 20:01:59,701 - INFO - I am currently at position (1,5) and have filled 20 out of 36 cells. This means I have 16 cells remaining to fill.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- I'm at (1,5) in the top-right area
- The only available move is (2,5)
- I only have one clue (clue 1) which I've already visited at the start
- Since there are no more numbered clues to visit, I need to create a path that fills all remaining empty cells

Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) in row 1
- (2,1), (2,3), (2,5) in row 2
- (2,2), (3,5) in rows 2-3
- (3,1), (3,5) in row 3
- (4,1), (4,4), (4,5) in row 4
- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) in row 5

From (1,5), my only available move is (2,5) since:
- (0,5) is already visited (position 19)
- (1,4) is already visited (position 1, the starting clue)
- (2,5) is the only unvisited adjacent cell

After moving to (2,5), I need to ensure I can reach all remaining empty cells without getting trapped. The critical areas to watch are:
- The cells in rows 1-2 (columns 1-3) that form a cluster
- The cells in rows 3-5 (right side) that need to be connected
- Making sure I don't create any isolated regions

Moving to (2,5) keeps me on the right edge, allowing me to potentially sweep down and then work my way back through the middle sections.

2025-12-10 20:02:30,399 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (3,5)
- Progress: 22/36 cells filled
- Only one available move: (4,5)

**Remaining empty cells to fill:** 36 - 22 = 14 cells

Let me map out what's left:
- Row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) - 3 cells
- Row 2: (2,1), (2,3) - 2 cells
- Row 3: (3,1) - 1 cell
- Row 4: (4,4), (4,5) - 2 cells
- Row 5: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) - 3 cells

Plus the cells I'm about to visit = 11 more cells to fill after the current position.

Wait, let me recount the empty cells from the visual board:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) = 3
- (2,1), (2,3) = 2
- (3,1) = 1
- (4,4), (4,5) = 2
- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) = 3
Total empty: 11 cells

Current filled: 22 cells
22 + 11 = 33 cells

But we need 36 cells total. Let me check the clue cells:
- Clue 1 at (1,4) - already visited as step 1
- Clue 6 at (4,2) - already visited as step 7
- Clue 5 at (4,3) - already visited as step 6
- Clue 4 at (3,3) - already visited as step 4

Wait, I need to recount. Looking at the path taken, it has 22 positions, so 22 cells are filled.
Total cells = 6×6 = 36
Remaining = 36 - 22 = 14 cells

**Available move:** Only (4,5) is available from (3,5).

**Strategy consideration:**
From (4,5), I need to continue filling the remaining empty cells. Let me trace what happens if I move to (4,5):
- From (4,5), I can move to (4,4) or (5,5)
- I need to fill: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)

The path should eventually connect all these remaining cells. Since there's only one available move, I must take it.

After moving to (4,5), from there I'll need to carefully navigate to fill all remaining cells without creating dead ends.

**Evaluation:**
(4,5) is the only available move, so I must take it. From (4,5), I'll have access to (4,4) and (5,5), allowing me to continue the path into the bottom-right corner and then work my way back up to fill the remaining cells in the upper-left area.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (4,5)
- Progress: 23/36 cells filled, so 13 cells remain
- I started at clue 1 at (1,4) and have been following a path
- Available moves: (5,5) or (4,4)

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the visual board, I can see the clue numbers on the board:
- Clue 1 at (1,4) - already visited (position [1] in path)
- Clue 2 appears to be at (2,4) - already visited (position [2] in path)
- Clue 3 appears to be implicit in the path
- Clue 4 at (3,3) - already visited (position [4] in path)
- Clue 5 at (4,3) - already visited (position [5] in path)
- Clue 6 at (4,2) - already visited (position [6] in path)

The remaining empty cells that need to be filled are:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) in row 1
- (2,1), (2,3) in row 2
- (3,1) in row 3
- (4,4) in row 4
- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) in row 5

3. EVALUATION:
From (4,5), I have two options:

Option A: Move to (5,5)
- This moves down to the bottom-right corner
- From (5,5), I could only move to (5,4) next
- This would start filling the bottom row from right to left
- After filling bottom row cells (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3), I'd be at (5,3)
- From (5,3), I could move up to (4,4), which is an empty cell that needs filling
- This seems like a viable path

Option B: Move to (4,4)
- This moves left along row 4
- From (4,4), I'd need to continue somewhere - possibly up to (3,4) but that's already filled
- Or down to (5,4)
- If I go to (4,4) first, I'd likely go down to (5,4), then to (5,5) or (5,3)
- This could potentially trap me or make it harder to fill remaining cells in rows 1-3

4. DECISION:
Looking at the remaining unfilled cells, I need to eventually work my way back up to fill the cells in rows 1-3 (specifically (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)). 

If I go (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) is already filled, so from (4,4) I'd go up to (3,4)... wait, (3,4) is already position [3] in my path.

Let me reconsider: From (4,4), I could go to (5,4). And the path would need to snake through the remaining cells.

Actually, moving to (5,5) first allows me to clear the bottom-right corner, then work systematically through the remaining cells. The path would be: (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> then up to fill (4,4) and continue to the upper unfilled cells.

2025-12-10 20:02:50,757 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 20:02:50,758 - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (4,5)
- Progress: 23/36 cells filled, so 13 cells remain
- I started at clue 1 at (1,4) and have been following a path
- Available moves: (5,5) or (4,4)

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the visual board, I can see the clue numbers on the board:
- Clue 1 at (1,4) - already visited (position [1] in path)
- Clue 2 appears to be at (2,4) - already visited (position [2] in path)
- Clue 3 appears to be implicit in the path
- Clue 4 at (3,3) - already visited (position [4] in path)
- Clue 5 at (4,3) - already visited (position [5] in path)
- Clue 6 at (4,2) - already visited (position [6] in path)

The remaining empty cells that need to be filled are:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) in row 1
- (2,1), (2,3) in row 2
- (3,1) in row 3
- (4,4) in row 4
- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) in row 5

3. EVALUATION:
From (4,5), I have two options:

Option A: Move to (5,5)
- This moves down to the bottom-right corner
- From (5,5), I could only move to (5,4) next
- This would start filling the bottom row from right to left
- After filling bottom row cells (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3), I'd be at (5,3)
- From (5,3), I could move up to (4,4), which is an empty cell that needs filling
- This seems like a viable path

Option B: Move to (4,4)
- This moves left along row 4
- From (4,4), I'd need to continue somewhere - possibly up to (3,4) but that's already filled
- Or down to (5,4)
- If I go to (4,4) first, I'd likely go down to (5,4), then to (5,5) or (5,3)
- This could potentially trap me or make it harder to fill remaining cells in rows 1-3

4. DECISION:
Looking at the remaining unfilled cells, I need to eventually work my way back up to fill the cells in rows 1-3 (specifically (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)). 

If I go (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) is already filled, so from (4,4) I'd go up to (3,4)... wait, (3,4) is already position [3] in my path.

Let me reconsider: From (4,4), I could go to (5,4). And the path would need to snake through the remaining cells.

Actually, moving to (5,5) first allows me to clear the bottom-right corner, then work systematically through the remaining cells. The path would be: (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> then up to fill (4,4) and continue to the upper unfilled cells.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (5,5)
- Progress: 24/36 cells filled, so 12 cells remain
- Only one available move: (5,4)
- Looking at the board, I can see clue numbers at: 1 at (1,4), and numbered clues at various positions (4, 5, 6 visible on the board)
- The path has traced around the perimeter and is now in the bottom-right corner

2. STRATEGY:
- Since there's only one available move (5,4), I need to take it
- After moving to (5,4), I'll need to continue filling the remaining empty cells
- Looking at the board, the empty cells (marked with '.') are at:
  - Row 1: (1,1), (1,2)
  - Row 2: (2,1), (2,3)
  - Row 3: (3,1)
  - Row 4: (4,1), (4,4)
  - Row 5: (5,3), (5,4)
- I need to find a path that visits all remaining 12 cells

3. EVALUATION:
- Move (5,4): This is the only option available
  - Pros: It's the only legal move; it keeps me on the bottom row where I can then move to (5,3)
  - Cons: None, as it's the only option
  - From (5,4), I can move to (5,3) or (4,4)

4. DECISION:
- I must move to (5,4) as it's the only available move
- From there, I'll likely need to move to (5,3), then navigate upward to fill the remaining empty cells in the middle of the board
- The path should snake through the remaining empty cells to complete the puzzle

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,4)
- Progress: 25/36 cells filled, so I need to fill 11 more cells
- I started at clue 1 at (1,4) and there are no other clues visible on the board
- Available moves: (4,4) or (5,3)

2. REMAINING CELLS TO VISIT:
Looking at the visual board, the empty cells (marked with '.') are:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
- (2,1), (2,3)
- (3,1), (3,2)
- (4,1), (4,4)
- (5,3)

That's 10 empty cells plus my current position makes 11 cells remaining - this matches!

3. STRATEGY EVALUATION:

Let me trace what happens with each move:

Option A: Move to (5,3)
- This moves left along row 5
- From (5,3), I could potentially move to (4,3) - but that's already visited!
- So from (5,3), I'd be forced to go back, which is impossible
- This would create a dead end!

Option B: Move to (4,4)
- This moves up to row 4
- From (4,4), I can access (4,3) - already visited, or (3,4) - already visited
- Wait, let me reconsider: from (4,4) I could move to (5,4) - already there, (4,5) - already visited, (4,3) - already visited, or (3,4) - already visited
- This also seems problematic!

Let me re-examine the board more carefully. Looking at the path:
- Row 4: cells at (4,0), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5) are visited
- Cell (4,1) and (4,4) are empty

Actually, if I go to (4,4):
- From (4,4), I can only move to adjacent unvisited cells
- (3,4) is visited [step 3], (5,4) is current [step 25], (4,5) is visited [step 23], (4,3) is visited [step 5]
- So (4,4) would be a dead end too!

Wait, let me reconsider (5,3):
- From (5,3), adjacent cells are: (5,2) visited, (5,4) current, (4,3) visited
- This is also a dead end!

This seems wrong. Let me think about the full remaining path. I need to fill:
(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,4), (5,3)

The only way this works is if I can create a path that visits all these cells. From (5,4), I must go to either (4,4) or (5,3). 

If I go to (5,3), then to (4,3) - already visited. Dead end.

If I go to (4,4), I need to find a way to reach the other empty cells. From (4,4), I could go to... wait, all adjacent cells are visited!

Let me recount the visited cells around (4,4):
- North (3,4): visited as step 3
- South (5,4): current position
- East (4,5): visited as step 23  
- West (4,3): visited as step 5

And around (5,3):
- North (4,3): visited as step 5
- South: out of bounds
- East (5,4): current position
- West (5,2): visited as step 7

Both moves lead to dead ends! But one must work... unless I made an error in reading the board.

Actually, I should choose (5,3) because it's the only move that allows me to potentially continue, even though it seems blocked. Perhaps there's an error in my analysis.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:03:43,649 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- I'm at position (5,3) 
- I've filled 26 out of 36 cells
- 10 cells remain to be filled
- The problem states "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" which suggests I may have made an error

**Examining the unfilled cells:**
Looking at the visual board, the empty cells (marked with '.') are:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
- (2,1), (2,3)
- (3,1)
- (4,1), (4,4)

That's 8 empty cells, plus I need to account for positions that show clue numbers but haven't been visited yet.

**Clue Analysis:**
- Clue 1 is at (1,4) - already visited as step [1]
- I see clue numbers 4, 5, 6 on the board at:
  - Clue 4: (3,3) - visited as step [4]
  - Clue 5: (4,3) - visited as step [5]
  - Clue 6: (4,2) - visited as step [6]

Wait, let me recount the path. Looking at my path, I started at (1,4) which is clue 1, and I've been following a continuous path. The board shows bracketed numbers indicating my path order.

**Problem Identification:**
From (5,3), my available moves would be:
- Up to (4,3) - already visited as step [5]
- Down: out of bounds
- Left to (5,2) - already visited as step [7]
- Right to (5,4) - already visited as step [25]

Indeed, I am stuck! All adjacent cells have been visited.

**Analyzing where the mistake occurred:**
Looking at the path, I need to fill all 36 cells. The unfilled cells are in the middle area around rows 1-4, columns 1-3. The issue is that I've created a path that isolated these cells before visiting them.

The critical mistake appears to be in how I navigated through the middle section. When I was at positions like (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), I should have taken a different route to ensure I could reach all the empty cells in the middle-left area.

**Conclusion:**
This puzzle state is unsolvable from the current position. I am genuinely stuck with no valid moves available. The path needs to be reconsidered from an earlier point to avoid isolating the remaining empty cells.

Since the problem asks for my next move but there are no valid moves available, I cannot proceed. The puzzle has reached a dead-end state.

MOVE: No valid move available - puzzle is in an unsolvable state from current position (5,3). All adjacent cells have already been visited.

- The puzzle indicates "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" which suggests I need to analyze if there's actually a valid path forward

Looking at the visual board:

- (5,2) - already visited (step 7)
- (5,4) - already visited (step 25)
- (4,3) - already visited (step 5)
- Can't move down (out of bounds)

Wait, let me reconsider. The system says I'm stuck, but let me trace through what cells are still empty:
- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) - marked with "."
- (2,1), (2,3) - marked with "."
- (3,1) - marked with "."
- (4,1), (4,4) - marked with "."

The clue numbers visible on the board are:
- Clue 1 at (1,4) - already part of path
- Clue 4 at (3,3) - already visited as step 4
- Clue 5 at (4,2) - already visited as step 6
- Clue 6 at (1,3) - NOT yet visited in path!

Wait! I see the issue. Looking at the board again:
- Position (1,3) shows "6" which is a clue
- Position (2,2) shows "5" which is a clue  
- Position (3,2) shows "4" which is a clue

But these are CLUE positions, not path positions. Let me re-analyze:

Actually, reviewing the path more carefully, I'm at (5,3) and all adjacent cells have been visited. This appears to be a genuine stuck position based on the path taken.

However, if I'm truly stuck, this means there was an error in the previous moves. But since I'm asked to provide the next move, let me check if there's any cell I can legally move to from (5,3):

From (5,3):
- Up to (4,3): Already visited (step 5)
- Down: Out of bounds
- Left to (5,2): Already visited (step 7)
- Right to (5,4): Already visited (step 25)

This confirms I am indeed stuck. This puzzle state appears to be unsolvable from the current position as constructed. The path has created a situation where the remaining unvisited cells are now unreachable.

Since the system indicates I'm stuck and there are no valid moves, I cannot provide a legal move from this position.

2025-12-10 20:05:14,406 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (1,3)
- Cells filled: 3/36
- Path so far: (0,2) [clue 1] -> (0,3) -> (1,3)
- Next clue to reach: Clue 2 at position (3,5)
- Available moves: (2,3), (1,2), (1,4)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to visit clue 2 at (3,5) next
- From (1,3), I need to navigate toward (3,5)
- The direct path would involve moving down and right
- I have 36 cells total to fill, so I need to be efficient but also ensure I can visit every cell

3. EVALUATION OF EACH MOVE:

Move (1,2) - Moving LEFT:
- Takes me AWAY from clue 2 at (3,5)
- Would require backtracking later
- Could create path complications
- Pros: Opens up the left side of the board
- Cons: Wrong direction from target

Move (1,4) - Moving RIGHT:
- Moves me closer to clue 2's column (column 5)
- Good horizontal progress toward (3,5)
- Keeps options open for vertical movement
- Pros: Right direction, maintains flexibility
- Cons: Need to ensure I can still cover all cells

Move (2,3) - Moving DOWN:
- Moves me closer to clue 2's row (row 3)
- Good vertical progress toward (3,5)
- Column 3 has clue number 7 at (3,3), which I'll need later
- Pros: Progresses toward target row
- Cons: May limit upper board coverage

4. DECISION:

Since I need to reach clue 2 at (3,5) and I have 33 more cells to fill after this move, I should move strategically. Moving to (1,4) takes me right (toward column 5) while keeping row 1, which allows me to potentially sweep across and create an efficient path.

However, looking at the board layout, I notice I need to eventually cover all 36 cells. If I move right to (1,4), I can then continue right to (1,5), then potentially snake down. This seems like a good strategy to ensure full coverage.

Move (2,3) would take me down into the middle of the board too early, potentially creating path problems.

Move (1,2) goes away from the target completely.

The best move is (1,4) - it progresses toward clue 2 and maintains good path options for covering the entire board.

   b) (2,4) - Moving DOWN:
      - Takes me closer to clue 2 at (3,5) (which is at row 3)
      - More direct path toward the goal
      - Pros: Moving toward clue 2
      - Cons: Might leave the top-right corner (0,4) and (0,5) isolated
   
   c) (1,5) - Moving RIGHT:
      - Takes me to the rightmost column
      - Clue 2 is also in column 5, so this aligns vertically with my goal
      - From (1,5), I can move down the right edge toward (3,5)
      - Pros: Aligns with clue 2's column, allows systematic filling along the edge
      - Cons: Must ensure I can still reach all cells

4. DECISION:
   Looking at the board strategically, if I move to (1,5), I'll be in the right column where clue 2 is located. This allows me to work down the right edge systematically. However, I need to make sure I can still fill (0,4) and (0,5).

   If I go to (0,4) first, I can then go to (0,5), then down to (1,5), and continue down to reach clue 2 at (3,5). This fills the top-right corner completely before moving down.

   The move to (0,4) is optimal because:
   - It prevents the top-right area from becoming isolated
   - It allows a systematic sweep of the right side of the board
   - It still maintains a clear path to clue 2

2025-12-10 20:05:31,689 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 20:05:31,689 - INFO - I am currently at position (1,4) and have filled 4 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:
   - Path so far: (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4)
   - Started at clue 1 at (0,2)
   - Need to visit clue 2 at (3,5) next
   - Current position: (1,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - My next goal is to reach clue 2 at position (3,5)
   - From (1,4), I need to navigate toward (3,5)
   - I must visit all 36 cells, so I need to be careful not to create unreachable areas

3. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:
   
   a) (0,4) - Moving UP:
      - Takes me to row 0, closer to the top edge
      - From there, I could go to (0,5) and then work my way down
      - This could help me fill the top-right corner before heading to clue 2
      - Pros: Fills the top-right area systematically
      - Cons: None immediately apparent
   
   b) (2,4) - Moving DOWN:
      - Takes me closer to clue 2 at (3,5) (which is at row 3)
      - More direct path toward the goal
      - Pros: Moving toward clue 2
      - Cons: Might leave the top-right corner (0,4) and (0,5) isolated
   
   c) (1,5) - Moving RIGHT:
      - Takes me to the rightmost column
      - Clue 2 is also in column 5, so this aligns vertically with my goal

      - Pros: Aligns with clue 2's column, allows systematic filling along the edge
      - Cons: Must ensure I can still reach all cells

I am currently at position (0,5) and have filled 6 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
   - Current position: (0,5) - top-right corner
   - Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (0,2), moved through 6 cells
   - Next clue to reach: Clue 2 at position (3,5)
   - Only one available move: (1,5) - moving down from my current position

2. STRATEGY:
   - I need to reach clue 2 at (3,5)
   - Currently at (0,5), which is in the same column as clue 2
   - Clue 2 is 3 rows below me at (3,5)
   - I need to fill all 36 cells, so I must plan carefully to avoid trapping myself

3. EVALUATION:
   - Move (1,5): This moves me down one row, keeping me in column 5
     PROS: 
     - Progresses toward clue 2 at (3,5)
     - Stays in the rightmost column
     - This is the only available move, so I must take it
     CONS:
     - I need to be careful not to reach clue 2 too quickly, as I have 30 more cells to fill after reaching it
     - I should plan to explore other areas before directly reaching (3,5)

4. DECISION:
   - Since (1,5) is the only available move, I must take it
   - From (1,5), I'll need to plan my path carefully to visit all cells before ending at clue 2
   - Looking at the board, I should consider moving left from (1,5) to explore the rest of the board systematically before returning to complete the path at (3,5)

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,5) and have filled 8 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (2,5)
   - Cells filled: 8/36
   - Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (3,5)
   - Available moves: (3,5) and (2,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (3,5)
   - After visiting clue 2, I need to continue filling all remaining cells in the 6x6 grid
   - I must ensure I don't trap myself or leave cells unreachable

3. EVALUATION:
   - Move to (3,5): This move takes me directly to clue 2, which is exactly what I need to do next according to the rules. This is the required next clue in sequence.
   - Move to (2,4): This would take me away from clue 2 and delay visiting it. Since I must visit clues in ascending order and clue 2 is my next target, this would not be optimal.

4. DECISION:
   - I should move to (3,5) to visit clue 2. This follows the puzzle rules of visiting clues in ascending order (1 -> 2). After reaching clue 2, I'll need to plan a path that covers all remaining 28 cells without getting trapped.

2025-12-10 20:06:32,940 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,5), which is clue 2 (the highest clue). I have filled 9 out of 36 cells. Since I've reached the highest numbered clue (clue 2), I now need to fill the remaining 27 cells to complete the puzzle.

Current situation analysis:
- I'm at (3,5) in the top-right area of the board
- Available moves: (4,5) and (3,4)
- I need to visit all remaining 27 empty cells without revisiting any cell
- The path must be continuous and cover the entire 6x6 grid

Strategy considerations:
Since I've already visited all clues, my goal now is to create a path that visits every remaining cell exactly once. I need to be careful not to create isolated regions or dead ends that would prevent me from completing the puzzle.

Evaluation of moves:
1. Move to (4,5): This moves down one row, keeping me on the rightmost column. This would allow me to potentially snake down and then work my way back through the board.

2. Move to (3,4): This moves left one column. From here, I could continue exploring the middle area of the board.

Looking at the board layout, I need to ensure I can reach all empty cells. The left side of the board (columns 0-2) has many empty cells that I haven't visited yet. If I go to (4,5), I can continue down to (5,5), then snake left across row 5, which gives me good access to the lower portion of the board.

Moving to (3,4) would take me into the middle of the board earlier, but given that I have a large continuous area to the left and below, it's better to work systematically from the edge.

DECISION: Move to (4,5) to continue down the right edge, allowing me to systematically cover the bottom of the board before snaking back through the remaining cells.

2025-12-10 20:07:04,230 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (5,5) - bottom-right corner
- Progress: 11/36 cells filled
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- All clues have been visited, so now I need to fill the remaining 25 empty cells

**Available Move:**
- Only option: (5,4) - moving left from current position

**Strategic Analysis:**
Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to create a Hamiltonian path that visits all remaining 25 empty cells exactly once. This is crucial - I need to ensure I don't trap myself or leave cells unreachable.

Looking at the board:
- I'm at (5,5), the bottom-right corner
- The only available move is (5,4)
- I need to carefully plan a path that covers all empty cells in rows 0-5, columns 0-3, and some cells in column 4

**Path Planning Considerations:**
From (5,4), I'll need to work my way through the bottom row, then snake through the remaining empty cells. The key is to avoid creating isolated regions that I can't reach later.

The remaining empty cells form a large connected region on the left side of the board. I should:
1. Move to (5,4)
2. Continue along row 5 to cover that row
3. Snake up through the grid systematically
4. Avoid creating unreachable pockets

**Evaluation of (5,4):**
- Pros: It's the only legal move, keeps me connected to the path
- Cons: None - it's mandatory
- Future implications: From (5,4), I can continue left along row 5 or move up to (4,4)

Since there's only one available move, this decision is straightforward.

MOVE: (5,4)

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- Current position: (5,2)
- Progress: 14/36 cells filled
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest clue, I've visited all required clues
- Now I need to fill the remaining 22 cells (36 - 14 = 22) to complete the puzzle
- I'm in the bottom-left area of the board

**2. STRATEGY - What's Next:**
- All clues have been visited (1 and 2)
- My goal is to fill all remaining empty cells without getting trapped
- I need to create a Hamiltonian path that covers all 36 cells
- I must avoid creating isolated regions that would be impossible to visit

**3. EVALUATION - Available Moves:**

Option A: **(4,2)** - Moving UP
- This takes me back up into the middle of the board
- Looking at the board, cells (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) form a vertical/horizontal corridor
- The left side of the board (columns 0-1) is completely untouched
- Moving up allows me to sweep through the left side systematically

- This takes me to the bottom-left corner area
- From (5,1), I could go to (5,0) or (4,1)
- If I go left first, I might trap myself in the corner
- The left columns (0 and 1) have many empty cells that need careful planning

**4. DECISION:**

I should choose **(4,2)** - moving UP.

**Reasoning:**
- Moving to (4,2) keeps more options open and allows better strategic planning
- From (4,2), I can continue upward through column 2, then sweep left into columns 0-1
- The left side of the board (columns 0-1) has 12 untouched cells that need to be visited
- By going up first, I can approach the left side from above, creating a more natural sweeping pattern
- If I go to (5,1) first, I risk getting trapped in the bottom-left corner with limited escape routes
- Moving up maintains flexibility and allows me to fill the board systematically from top-to-bottom in the remaining sections

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:08:13,462 - INFO - THINKING:

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- Current position: (4,2)
- Progress: 15/36 cells filled (21 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- Since there are only 2 clues and I've visited both, I now need to fill the remaining 21 cells to complete the puzzle
- My path has covered the right side and bottom of the board

**2. STRATEGY:**
- All clues have been visited (1 and 2)
- Goal: Fill all remaining 21 empty cells without trapping myself
- Need to ensure I can reach all unfilled areas without creating isolated regions

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

Let me visualize the current empty cells:
- Top-left area: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1)
- Middle area: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)
- Bottom-right: (2,4), (4,4)

Available moves from (4,2):
- **(3,2)**: Move up - This enters the large unfilled left region from the middle
- **(4,1)**: Move left - This enters the left region from the bottom
- **(4,3)**: Move right - This enters the middle column area

**Analyzing each option:**

**(3,2) - Moving up:**
- Enters the left region from middle-left
- Creates flexibility to navigate the large unfilled area
- Could access (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) from here
- Risk: Need to ensure I can cover all cells systematically

**(4,1) - Moving left:**
- Enters the left region from bottom-left
- Would need to work my way up the left side
- This seems more constraining as I'd be at the bottom edge

**(4,3) - Moving right:**
- Fills a cell in the middle column
- From (4,3), I could reach (4,4), (3,3), or (2,3)
- However, this might trap me in the middle area before I've covered the large left region
- If I go right and get stuck, I might not be able to reach all left-side cells

**4. DECISION:**

The key insight is that I have a large contiguous region on the left (15 cells) and a few scattered cells on the right-middle. I need to plan a path that can sweep through all remaining cells.

Move **(4,1)** appears safest because:
- It allows me to systematically fill the bottom-left, then work upward through the left side
- From (4,1), I can go to (4,0), then up through column 0, sweeping across rows
- The left region is the largest unfilled area, so entering it strategically is crucial
- Starting from the bottom-left corner gives me a natural boundary to work with

Move **(3,2)** is also viable but puts me in the middle of the region, which could make systematic coverage trickier.

Move **(4,3)** is risky as it delays dealing with the large left region and could create isolation issues.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:09:30,774 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 20:09:30,774 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,1)
- Cells filled: 19/36 (17 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I don't need to visit any more specific clues
- My goal now is to fill all remaining 17 empty cells in a continuous path

2. REMAINING EMPTY CELLS:
Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,1)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,2), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,3)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

That's 14 empty cells, plus 3 cells with clues that haven't been counted in our path yet (wait, let me recount).

Actually, looking at the visual board:
- Cells marked with [numbers] are part of my path (19 cells)
- Cells marked with plain numbers are clue locations (already visited)
- Cells marked with "." are empty (need to visit)

Empty cells to visit: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (5,0), (5,1) = 14 cells
Plus current 19 = 33 cells. Need 36 total, so 3 more cells somewhere...

Let me recount the board more carefully. I see clue "3" at (2,2), clue "7" at (3,3), and clue "6" at (4,4) on the visual board - these appear to be clue numbers but aren't in my clue list. This means they're just part of the empty cells I need to fill.

3. AVAILABLE MOVES:
- (2,1): Moving up
- (3,2): Moving right

4. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (2,1)
- This moves me upward into the upper-left region
- From (2,1), I could access (1,1), (2,0), or potentially (2,2)
- This would help me sweep through the upper-left corner
- I need to eventually cover (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)

Option B: Move to (3,2)
- This moves me right along row 3
- From (3,2), I could access (2,2), (3,3), or (4,2) (but (4,2) is already visited)
- This keeps me in the middle section
- Might make it harder to reach the upper-left corner later

5. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:
I need to ensure I can visit all remaining cells without getting trapped. The upper-left corner (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) has many unvisited cells. If I move to (3,2) first, I might have difficulty creating a path that covers all those cells efficiently.

Moving to (2,1) allows me to work through the upper-left systematically, then come back down through the middle section.

DECISION:
Move to (2,1) to start filling the upper-left region of the board.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,1)

- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining empty cells
- Available moves: (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since all clues are visited, I need to fill the remaining 16 empty cells
- I must create a path that doesn't trap myself or leave cells unreachable
- Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
  - Row 0: (0,0), (0,1)

  - Row 4: (4,3), (4,4)
  - Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This moves upward and right
- From (1,1), I could access (0,1), (1,0), (1,2)
- This keeps me in the upper-left region where many empty cells remain
- Could potentially trap the (2,0) cell if not careful

Option B: Move to (2,0)
- This moves left to the edge
- From (2,0), I can only move to (1,0) (since (3,0) is already visited)
- This might create a dead-end situation since (2,0) is a corner position with limited escape routes
- If I go to (2,0) then (1,0), I'd need to continue to (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), which could work

Option C: Move to (2,2)
- This moves right
- From (2,2), I could access (1,2), (2,3)
- This separates me from the upper-left cluster of empty cells at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Could potentially trap those 5 cells in the upper-left

4. DECISION:

Looking at the board structure, I need to be careful not to isolate cells. The upper-left corner has a cluster of 5 empty cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).

If I move to (2,2), I'd be moving away from this cluster and might not be able to return to fill them all.

If I move to (2,0), I can then go (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2), which would fill the upper-left cluster nicely.

Moving to (1,1) directly could also work, but then I'd need to carefully navigate back to (2,0) and the other cells.

The safest approach is to move to (2,0) first, which allows me to sweep through the left side systematically.

Moving to (1,1) directly could also work, but then I'd need to carefully navigate back to (2,0) and the other cells.

The safest approach is to move to (2,0) first, which allows me to sweep through the left side systematically.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:10:01,469 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 21 out of 36 cells. This means I have 15 more cells to fill to complete the puzzle.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- I've already visited both clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5), so all mandatory clues are complete
- My current position is (2,0)
- I have only one available move: (1,0)
- I need to fill all remaining empty cells in one continuous path

Looking at the visual board, the remaining empty cells are:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,1)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,3), (4,4)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

That's 15 empty cells remaining, which matches 36 - 21 = 15.

Since I only have one available move (1,0), I must take it. Let me verify this doesn't create any problems:

From (1,0), I would be able to move to:
- (0,0) - empty
- (1,1) - empty
- Back to (2,0) - already visited, not allowed

The move to (1,0) is necessary and keeps me connected to the remaining empty cells. After moving to (1,0), I'll need to carefully navigate through the remaining cells to ensure I can visit all of them without getting trapped.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (1,0)
- Progress: 22/36 cells filled, so 14 cells remaining
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining empty cells
- Available moves: (0,0) and (1,1)

2. CURRENT EMPTY CELLS:
Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- (0,0), (0,1)
- (1,1), (1,2)
- (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
- (4,3), (4,4)
- (5,0), (5,1)

That's 14 empty cells, which matches our remaining count.

3. EVALUATION OF MOVES:

Option A: Move to (0,0)
- This would place me at the top-left corner
- From (0,0), I could only move to (0,1) next (since (1,0) is already visited)
- From (0,1), I could move to (1,1)
- This creates a path: (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> ...
- After reaching (1,1), I would need to access (1,2) and the remaining cells in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5

Option B: Move to (1,1)
- From (1,1), I could move to (0,1), (1,2), or (2,1) - but (2,1) is already visited
- So from (1,1), I could go to (0,1) or (1,2)
- If I go to (1,2), I can then access the middle empty cells
- If I go to (0,1) first, then (0,0), I'd be in a corner with limited options

4. DECISION:
I need to think about connectivity. The remaining empty cells form groups:
- Top-left corner: (0,0), (0,1)
- Middle-left: (1,1), (1,2)
- Middle section: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)
- Bottom-left: (5,0), (5,1)

From (1,0), if I go to (1,1), I can:
- Access (1,2) and then the large middle section
- Later come back to get (0,1) and (0,0)
- Or go to (0,1) first, then (0,0) (dead end), backtrack not allowed!

Wait, I can't backtrack! So I need to plan carefully.

If I go (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0), then I'm stuck in a corner.
If I go (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1), then from (1,1) I can continue to (1,2).

The path (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) seems viable and keeps options open.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,2)
- Cells filled: 27/36 (9 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining 9 empty cells

2. REMAINING CELLS TO VISIT:
Looking at the board, the unfilled cells are:
- (2,3), (2,4)
- (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
- (4,3), (4,4)
- (5,0), (5,1)

3. AVAILABLE MOVES:
From (2,2), I can move to:
- (3,2) - moves down
- (2,3) - moves right

4. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (3,2)
- This moves down into row 3
- From (3,2), I would need to navigate through (3,3), (3,4) in row 3
- Then access row 4 cells (4,3), (4,4)
- Then somehow get to (5,0) and (5,1) at the bottom left
- Looking at the path, cells (5,0) and (5,1) are isolated at the bottom left
- If I go down to (3,2), I'd need to eventually reach those bottom-left cells
- Path from (3,2) could be: (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> ... but then how do I reach (5,0) and (5,1)? They're blocked off!

Option B: Move to (2,3)
- This moves right into row 2
- From (2,3), I can continue to (2,4)
- Then I could go down: (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2)
- From (3,2), I could go down to connect with the bottom section
- But wait, (5,0) and (5,1) are still problematic - they're in the bottom left corner with no direct access

Let me reconsider the bottom left corner issue:
- Cells (5,0) and (5,1) are currently empty
- Cell (5,2) is already filled (position 14 in path)
- Cell (4,0) is already filled (position 17)
- Cell (4,1) is already filled (position 16)
- So (5,0) and (5,1) are completely surrounded by filled cells except they could be accessed from each other

This is a critical realization: (5,0) and (5,1) form an isolated pocket! They can only be accessed as the last two cells of the path, and only if I enter one and exit from the other isn't possible since they're a dead end.

Actually, looking more carefully: If I'm at (5,1), I can only go to (5,0) or back. This means (5,0) and (5,1) MUST be the last two cells, entered from above through a cell that connects to (5,1).

But all cells above (5,0) and (5,1) are already filled! This means the puzzle might have an issue... 

Wait, let me recheck: From the path, (5,2) is at position 14. Looking at adjacent cells to (5,0): only (5,1) is available. For (5,1): only (5,0) and possibly (4,1) - but (4,1) is already filled at position 16.

This means (5,0) and (5,1) are unreachable! 

Let me reconsider... Actually, I need to trace more carefully. The path must be able to reach all cells. Since I have 9 cells left and must visit them all, there must be a valid path.

Given the constraint, I should move to (2,3) to fill the upper cells first, then work my way down systematically.

2025-12-10 20:11:45,183 - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,2)
- Cells filled: 27/36 (9 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,2) and clue 2 at (3,5)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining 9 empty cells

2. REMAINING CELLS TO VISIT:
Looking at the board, the unfilled cells are:
- (2,3), (2,4)
- (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
- (4,3), (4,4)
- (5,0), (5,1)

3. AVAILABLE MOVES:
From (2,2), I can move to:
- (3,2) - moves down
- (2,3) - moves right

4. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (3,2)
- This moves down into row 3
- From (3,2), I would need to navigate through (3,3), (3,4) in row 3
- Then access row 4 cells (4,3), (4,4)
- Then somehow get to (5,0) and (5,1) at the bottom left
- Looking at the path, cells (5,0) and (5,1) are isolated at the bottom left
- If I go down to (3,2), I'd need to eventually reach those bottom-left cells
- Path from (3,2) could be: (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> ... but then how do I reach (5,0) and (5,1)? They're blocked off!

Option B: Move to (2,3)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,3)
- Cells filled: 28/36 (8 cells remaining)
- I've already visited both clues (1 at (0,2) and 2 at (3,5))
- Available moves: (3,3) or (2,4)

Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- (2,4)
- (3,2)
- (3,3)
- (3,4)
- (4,3)
- (4,4)
- (5,0)
- (5,1)

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all clues, my goal is to fill all remaining 8 cells without trapping myself. I need to create a path that covers all empty cells exactly once.

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (3,3)
- This moves me down to row 3
- From (3,3), I could potentially move to:
  - (3,2) - an empty cell to the left
  - (3,4) - an empty cell to the right
  - (4,3) - an empty cell below
- This gives me flexibility in row 3

Option B: Move to (2,4)
- This moves me right in row 2
- From (2,4), I can only move to:
  - (2,5) which is already filled [8]
  - (3,4) - an empty cell below
  - (1,4) which is already filled [4]
- This is more restrictive and would force me down to (3,4)

4. DECISION:
Let me trace potential paths:

If I go to (2,4):
- (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) or (4,3)
- If I go to (3,2), I'd need to continue but might get trapped
- If I go to (4,3), I need to eventually cover (3,2) which could be problematic

If I go to (3,3):
- (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (3,3)? NO! Can't revisit
- (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> needs path to (3,2), (5,0), (5,1)
- (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> ... this leaves (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (2,4), (5,0), (5,1)

Let me think more carefully about completing the path:

The remaining cells form clusters:
- Cluster 1: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2) - a connected region
- Cluster 2: (5,0), (5,1) - isolated in bottom-left

I need to reach (5,0) and (5,1) eventually. Looking at the board, the only way to reach them is from the already-filled cells, but wait - they're already surrounded by filled cells except they're not connected to my current region!

Actually, (5,0) and (5,1) are completely surrounded by filled cells. This means they're UNREACHABLE! Let me recheck...

Looking at (5,0): neighbors are (4,0)=[17], (5,1)=empty
Looking at (5,1): neighbors are (4,1)=[16], (5,0)=empty, (5,2)=[14]

These two cells form an isolated pocket! This is impossible to complete... unless I misread the board.

Wait, let me recount. The path shows cells up to [28], and we need 36 total. That's 8 more cells: (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4), (5,0), (5,1).

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:13:07,979 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0), which is clue 1, and have filled 1/36 cells. Looking at the board, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (4,5).

Let me analyze the situation:
- Current position: (0,0) - top-left corner
- Next target: Clue 2 at (4,5) - bottom-right area
- Total cells to fill: 36
- Distance to clue 2: I need to travel from (0,0) to (4,5), which requires moving 4 rows down and 5 columns right

Available moves:
1. (1,0) - Move down one row
2. (0,1) - Move right one column

Since I need to visit ALL 36 cells exactly once and end at clue 2 (the highest numbered clue), I need to plan a path that:
- Eventually reaches (4,5)
- Uses all 36 cells
- Doesn't trap myself in a corner

Strategy consideration:
Starting from the top-left corner (0,0), if I move right (0,1), I'll be traveling along the top edge. If I move down (1,0), I'll be traveling along the left edge. 

Given that clue 2 is at (4,5) in the bottom-right area, I need to create a path that efficiently covers all cells. A common approach for such puzzles is to use a snake-like pattern or spiral pattern.

Since I'm in the top-left corner and need to eventually reach the bottom-right, moving right (0,1) allows me to traverse the top row first, which is a good start for a snake pattern (going right across the top, then down, then left, then down, etc.).

However, I should also consider that moving down (1,0) would allow me to traverse the left column first.

Given the board is 6x6 = 36 cells, and I need to visit all of them, a systematic approach like:
- Traverse top row left to right
- Move down
- Traverse back right to left
- Move down
- Continue this snake pattern

This would naturally end me somewhere on the bottom row, and since clue 2 is at (4,5), I can adjust my pattern accordingly.

DECISION: Move right to (0,1) to begin traversing the top row, which sets up a good snake pattern for covering all cells.

I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 2 out of 36 cells. I started at clue 1 at (0,0) and moved to (0,1).

Looking at the clue locations:
- Clue 1: (0,0) - Already visited
- Clue 2: (4,5) - This is my next target

My current position is (0,1), which is in the top-left area of the board. Clue 2 is at (4,5), which is in the bottom-right corner. I need to create a path that:
1. Eventually reaches (4,5) for clue 2
2. Visits all 36 cells exactly once
3. Doesn't block myself into a corner

Available moves from (0,1):
- (1,1): Move down one row
- (0,2): Move right along the top row

EVALUATION:
- Option (0,2): This continues along the top row to the right. This would be good for a systematic approach where I traverse the top row first, then work my way down. However, I need to be careful not to create isolated regions.

- Option (1,1): This moves down into the board. This could be useful, but moving down too early might make it harder to cover the top-right area efficiently.

Given that this is a 6x6 board with 36 cells and only 2 clues, I have a lot of freedom in how I create my path. A common strategy for such puzzles is to use a systematic traversal pattern like a snake/zigzag pattern.

Since I'm at (0,1) and need to eventually reach (4,5), a good strategy would be to:
1. Complete the top row moving right
2. Then zigzag down through the board
3. End at (4,5)

Moving to (0,2) allows me to continue along the top row, which sets up for a clean snake pattern traversal.

DECISION: Moving to (0,2) is the better choice as it allows me to systematically fill the top row before moving down, which is a proven strategy for ensuring complete coverage without blocking myself.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:14:11,003 - INFO - THINKING:

**1. ANALYSIS: Current Situation**
- I am at position (1,3) with 5 out of 36 cells filled
- Path so far: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3)
- I've visited clue 1 at (0,0)
- Next target: clue 2 at position (4,5)
- Available moves: (2,3), (1,2), (1,4)

**2. STRATEGY: Path to Clue 2**
- Clue 2 is at (4,5), which is in the bottom-right area of the board
- From (1,3), I need to navigate towards (4,5)
- I have 31 more cells to fill before reaching (4,5)
- Since I must visit ALL cells exactly once, I need to plan a route that doesn't trap myself

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

**(2,3) - Moving Down:**
- Pros: Moves me closer to clue 2 (row-wise, from row 1 to row 2)
- Pros: Keeps options open in the middle of the board
- Cons: Need to ensure I can still cover all cells

**(1,2) - Moving Left:**
- Pros: Would allow me to revisit the left side if needed
- Cons: I'm backtracking horizontally (already been to column 2 in row 0)
- Cons: This creates potential issues - I'd be at (1,2), and the cells at (1,0) and (1,1) would become harder to reach without creating dead ends

**(1,4) - Moving Right:**
- Pros: Moves toward clue 2 (column-wise, from column 3 to column 4)
- Pros: Keeps me on the right side of the board where clue 2 is located
- Cons: Might box me into the right edge too early

**4. DECISION:**

Looking at the board structure, I need to fill all 36 cells. Moving to (1,2) would be backtracking and could create difficulties accessing (1,0) and (1,1) later without trapping myself.

Moving to (1,4) takes me right, toward clue 2's column (5), and I can then potentially snake down the right side or create a pattern that covers the board systematically.

Moving to (2,3) goes down and keeps me in the center, which offers flexibility.

The best strategy for a 6x6 board is typically to create a snake-like pattern. Since I've covered the top row partially (0,0 to 0,3), I should continue building a path that allows me to systematically cover all cells. 

Move (1,4) is optimal because:
- It progresses toward clue 2's column
- From (1,4), I can access (1,5) and then potentially snake down the right edge
- It doesn't create immediate dead ends
- It keeps the path flowing naturally toward the target

I am currently at position (1,4) and have filled 6 out of 36 cells. My path so far: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4). I started at clue 1 (position 0,0) and need to reach clue 2 at position (4,5) next.

Available moves from (1,4):
- (0,4): Moving up to row 0. This would give me access to (0,5) to complete the top row. However, this creates a potential issue - after visiting (0,4) and (0,5), I'd need to come back down, and I might create isolated regions.
  
- (2,4): Moving down. This continues my descent towards clue 2 at (4,5). From (2,4), I can continue building a path that sweeps through the board systematically.
  
- (1,5): Moving right to the rightmost column. This gets me to column 5 where clue 2 is located. From (1,5), I could move down the right edge towards (4,5).

Let me think about the long-term implications:
- If I go to (0,4), I'd visit (0,4) -> (0,5), then need to come back down. This could work if I snake through the board properly.
- If I go to (1,5), I move to the right edge and could go down: (1,5) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) reaching clue 2. But this would only be 10 cells total, leaving 26 cells unvisited before reaching clue 2, which violates the puzzle requirements.
- If I go to (2,4), I can create a more flexible path that allows me to sweep through more of the board before reaching clue 2.

The key insight: I need to fill ALL 36 cells, ending at clue 2. So I should NOT rush to clue 2. Instead, I should create a path that visits as many cells as possible while keeping clue 2 accessible as the final destination.

4. DECISION:
(0,4) is the best move. This allows me to complete the top-right area (0,4) -> (0,5), then I can snake down through the board in a systematic way, eventually reaching (4,5) as my last cell. This creates a natural snake pattern that can cover all cells.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:14:41,241 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 20:14:41,242 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,4) and have filled 7 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:
   - I've visited clue 1 at (0,0)
   - I need to reach clue 2 at (4,5) next
   - My path so far: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (0,4)
   - Only one available move: (0,5)

2. STRATEGY:
   - My next objective is to reach clue 2 at position (4,5)
   - From (0,4), I can only move to (0,5) as it's the only available adjacent cell
   - After moving to (0,5), I'll be at the top-right corner

3. EVALUATION OF (0,5):
   PROS:
   - It's the only legal move available
   - It positions me in the top-right corner
   - From (0,5), I can move down along the right edge toward clue 2 at (4,5)
   - This keeps the right column available as a corridor to reach clue 2
   
   CONS:
   - None really, as it's the only move and it's strategically sound
   - I need to be careful about how I navigate down to (4,5) to ensure I can fill all 36 cells

4. DECISION:
   Move to (0,5) is the only option and it's a good strategic move. From there, I should plan to move down the right column toward clue 2, being mindful to leave enough unvisited cells to complete the entire 36-cell path.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (3,5)
- Progress: 11/36 cells filled
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (4,5)
- Available moves: (4,5) and (3,4)

**Analysis:**

1. **Where am I?** I'm at (3,5), the rightmost column, row 3.

2. **What clue do I need next?** I need to reach Clue 2 at (4,5).

3. **Evaluating available moves:**

   **Option A: Move to (4,5)**
   - This is Clue 2's location - EXACTLY where I need to go next!
   - This would complete the requirement to visit clue 2
   - After visiting (4,5), I would have 12/36 cells filled
   - From (4,5), I could continue to explore the remaining 24 cells
   - This is a direct path to the next required clue

   **Option B: Move to (3,4)**
   - This moves me away from Clue 2
   - I would still need to reach (4,5) eventually
   - This could potentially create path complications
   - Might box myself in or create unnecessary detours

4. **Path Planning Consideration:**
   - After reaching Clue 2 at (4,5), I'll need to fill the remaining 24 cells
   - From (4,5), I can move to (4,4) or (5,5)
   - The bottom half of the board (rows 4-5) and left side are mostly unvisited
   - I need to ensure I can create a continuous path through all remaining cells

5. **Decision:** 
   Moving to (4,5) is clearly the correct choice because:
   - It's the mandatory next clue (Clue 2)
   - It maintains the rule of visiting clues in ascending order
   - It positions me well to continue filling the rest of the board
   - Delaying this move serves no strategic purpose

2025-12-10 20:15:52,641 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,5), which is clue 2. I have filled 12 out of 36 cells. Since I've reached clue 2 (the highest numbered clue), I now need to complete the remaining 24 cells to fill the entire 6x6 board.

Current situation analysis:
- I'm at (4,5) in the bottom-right area
- Available moves: (5,5) and (4,4)
- I need to fill 24 more cells
- The unfilled area includes most of rows 2-5 and columns 0-3

Strategy considerations:
Since I've visited both clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to create a path that visits all remaining cells exactly once. I need to be careful not to create isolated regions or dead ends.

Evaluating available moves:

Option 1: Move to (5,5)
- This moves to the bottom-right corner
- From (5,5), I would only have one exit: back through cells I need to fill
- This could be risky as corners are natural dead ends
- However, if I plan to snake back through row 5, this could work

Option 2: Move to (4,4)
- This moves left along row 4
- Keeps more flexibility open
- From (4,4), I could move to (5,4), (4,3), or (3,4)
- This allows me to continue filling the board more systematically

Given that I have 24 cells left to fill, I need to think about creating a continuous path. Looking at the board:
- Row 5 is completely empty (6 cells)
- Most of rows 2, 3, and 4 on the left side are empty
- I need to avoid trapping myself

The better strategy is to move to (5,5) first (the corner), then snake back through row 5 from right to left, which gives me a natural path to continue filling the rest of the board. If I go to (4,4) now, I might have difficulty reaching (5,5) later without creating an isolated cell.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:16:30,363 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

1. **ANALYSIS - Current State:**
   - Current position: (5,4)
   - Cells filled: 14/36
   - Cells remaining: 22
   - I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
   - Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I need to eventually return to (4,5) as my endpoint
   - Wait, I'm already past (4,5) in my path! I visited it at step 12, but I'm now at step 14 at (5,4)
   - This means clue 2 is NOT my endpoint - I need to reconsider

Let me re-examine: The path shows I went to (4,5) [clue 2] at step 12, then continued to (5,5) and (5,4). Since the rules state I must END at the highest clue, and I've already passed through clue 2, there must be an error in my understanding OR I need to complete the path filling all 36 cells.

Actually, reviewing the visual board, I see the path continues past clue 2. The rule is to visit clues in order and END at the highest clue. Since I'm at (5,4) after visiting (4,5), I must fill all remaining cells and my path should naturally end back at or near clue 2's area, OR clue 2 is not the endpoint.

Wait - re-reading: "End your path at the highest numbered clue" - I already visited clue 2 at step 12. The path must visit all 36 cells, so I'll end at cell 36, which should be at clue 2's position. But I already passed it!

Let me reconsider the board state. Looking at the legend: "2" appears at (4,5) as a clue. My path visited it at step [12]. 

2. **STRATEGY - What needs to happen:**
   - I need to fill all 36 cells total
   - I have 22 cells left to fill
   - Available moves from (5,4): (4,4) or (5,3)
   - I need to ensure I can reach all unfilled cells without creating dead ends

3. **EVALUATION of moves:**

   **Option A: Move to (4,4)**
   - This moves up one row
   - From (4,4), I could access (3,4), (4,3), or back to (5,4) (already visited)
   - Looking at the board, (3,4) shows "6" and (4,4) area is empty
   - This keeps me in the right column area

   **Option B: Move to (5,3)**
   - This moves left along the bottom row
   - From (5,3), I could access (5,2), (4,3)
   - This starts filling the bottom row from right to left
   - Need to ensure I can eventually reach all the empty cells in the left portion

Looking at the unfilled areas:
- Bottom left area: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)
- Middle left area: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)
- Large upper left area: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
- Some cells in column 4: (3,4), (4,4)

I need to create a path that covers all these areas. Moving to (5,3) allows me to work along the bottom, then snake upward through the left side.

4. **DECISION:**
   Moving to (5,3) is better because it allows me to systematically fill the bottom row and then work my way up through the empty left portion of the board. If I go to (4,4) first, I might trap myself and be unable to reach the bottom-left corner efficiently.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,3)
- Progress: 15/36 cells filled, so 21 cells remaining
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I've completed all required clue visits
- Now I need to fill the remaining 21 cells to complete the puzzle

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal is to create a continuous path that fills all 36 cells
- I need to ensure I don't create any isolated regions that would become unreachable
- Looking at the board, I need to fill the bottom-left area and work my way through the empty spaces

3. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

Move to (4,3):
- This moves up from (5,3) to (4,3)
- From the visual board, row 4 has mostly empty cells except (4,1) which shows "5"
- This would allow me to continue filling the middle section
- Potential issue: I need to make sure I can reach all the empty cells in the bottom-left

Move to (5,2):
- This moves left from (5,3) to (5,2)
- This continues along row 5 towards the left side
- This would help fill the bottom row first
- From (5,2), I could continue to (5,1), then (5,0), ensuring I cover the bottom-left corner
- This seems safer as it systematically fills the bottom row before moving up

4. DECISION:
Looking at the unfilled cells, I see a large empty region in the lower-left portion of the board. If I move to (4,3), I might create a situation where I have to navigate awkwardly to reach all cells. Moving to (5,2) allows me to systematically fill row 5 from right to left, then work my way up through the empty regions. This gives me better control over filling all remaining cells without creating isolated regions.

The safest approach is to continue along row 5 to ensure I can reach cells (5,2), (5,1), and (5,0) before they become isolated.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:17:06,307 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,2) - bottom portion of the board
- Progress: 16/36 cells filled (less than half)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I need to eventually return to (4,5) to end my path
- However, I've already visited (4,5) as step 12, which means I've already passed through it!

Wait, let me re-read the rules. I need to END at the highest numbered clue. But I've already been to (4,5) at step 12 and continued past it. This seems problematic.

Actually, looking at the path again: I went from (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (5,2). So I visited clue 2 and continued. But the rules say I must END at the highest numbered clue.

Let me reconsider: Since there are only 2 clues (1 and 2), and I must end at clue 2 (the highest), I need to ensure my path ultimately terminates at (4,5). But I've already been there and moved past it, which means I cannot return to it (rule 6: never revisit a cell).

This appears to be an error in the current path. However, I must work with what I have and try to complete the puzzle from the current state.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited both clues and cannot return to (4,5), I need to fill all remaining 20 cells (36 total - 16 filled = 20 remaining) in a way that doesn't trap myself.

3. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:
From (5,2), I can move to:
- (4,2): Moving up to row 4
- (5,1): Moving left along row 5

Let me think about coverage:
- Looking at the board, I need to fill rows 1-4 extensively
- Row 5 only has positions (5,0) and (5,1) left unfilled
- If I go to (5,1) now, I'll need to then go to (5,0), potentially trapping myself in a corner
- If I go to (4,2), I can explore the upper portions of the board first

The left side of the board (columns 0-2) in rows 1-4 is largely empty. I need to ensure I can fill all these cells.

If I move to (5,1) then (5,0), I'd be in the bottom-left corner and would have to move up to (4,0). This could work, but let me check if (4,2) is better.

If I move to (4,2), I have more flexibility to snake through rows 4, 3, 2, 1 and then come back down the left side.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,2) gives me more flexibility to cover the large unfilled area in the middle-left of the board. I can then work my way through rows 4, 3, 2, 1 before eventually going down column 0 to complete the path.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,2)
- Cells filled: 17/36 (19 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest clue, I've completed all required clue visits
- Now I need to fill the remaining 19 empty cells in a valid path

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal is to create a continuous path that fills all remaining empty cells
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or create unreachable areas
- From (4,2), my options are: (3,2), (4,1), (4,3)

3. EVALUATION:

Let me examine the empty cells:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) - 3 cells
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) - 5 cells
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) - 4 cells (note: (3,4) shows "6" which seems to be part of the path)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,1), (4,3) - 3 cells (current position is (4,2))
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1) - 2 cells

Total empty cells to fill: 3+5+4+3+2 = 17 cells (but we have 19 remaining including current move)

Wait, let me recount from the visual:
Already filled: 17 positions in path
Remaining: 36 - 17 = 19 cells

Available moves:
a) (3,2) - Move up into row 3
b) (4,1) - Move left in row 4
c) (4,3) - Move right in row 4

Let me think about connectivity:
- If I go to (4,3), I'd be moving right, but (4,4) is already visited [12]
- If I go to (4,1), I'd be moving left toward (4,0)
- If I go to (3,2), I'd be moving up into the middle area

The bottom-left corner (5,0), (5,1), (4,0), (4,1) needs to be accessible. 
If I go up to (3,2) first, I might trap the bottom-left area.

Going to (4,1) allows me to continue left to (4,0), then I can sweep up through the left side and eventually cover the middle area.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,1) is best because:
- It keeps me connected to the bottom-left corner cells (5,0), (5,1), (4,0)
- I can create a path: (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (5,1) then work my way up
- This prevents trapping any cells
- The middle area (rows 1-3) can be filled systematically afterward

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:17:48,293 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,1)
- Progress: 18/36 cells filled, so I have 18 more cells to fill
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest clue, I've already passed through it, but I need to END at it
- Wait, let me reconsider: I started at clue 1 (0,0) and visited clue 2 (4,5) at step 12, but I'm now at (4,1) which is step 18
- This means I've moved past clue 2, which violates the rule that I should END at the highest clue

Actually, reviewing the path: I visited (4,5) which is clue 2 at position [12] in my path, but then continued to fill more cells. Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I should end there, not continue past it.

Let me reinterpret: Perhaps the puzzle allows me to visit clue 2 and then continue filling remaining cells, as long as I eventually return to end at clue 2? No, that doesn't make sense with "visit every cell exactly once."

Re-reading the rules: "End your path at the highest numbered clue" - this means clue 2 at (4,5) should be my FINAL position, but I've already been there and moved on. 

Wait, I see the issue now. Looking at the visual board, position (4,5) shows [12], meaning it was the 12th cell I visited. But the rules say to END at the highest clue. Since I can only visit each cell once, and I've already been to (4,5), this seems like an error in the game state.

However, let me work with what I have. I need to fill all 36 cells. I'm at (4,1) with 18 cells filled, so 18 cells remain.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited both clues, my goal now is to fill all remaining empty cells without blocking myself into a corner. I need to ensure I can create a continuous path through all 18 remaining cells.

Looking at the empty cells:
Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
Row 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

That's 18 empty cells - perfect!

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (4,1): (3,1), (5,1), (4,0)

- Move to (3,1): This goes upward. From (3,1), I could continue filling the left and middle portions of the board.
- Move to (5,1): This goes down to row 5. From there, I'd need to work my way back up and around.
- Move to (4,0): This goes left to the edge. From there, I'd be at the corner and would need to navigate carefully.

Let me think about which path allows me to visit all remaining cells:
If I go to (5,1), then I could go to (5,0), then up through (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), then right through row 1 and down through the middle section.

If I go to (4,0), I'm immediately at the corner, which limits options.

If I go to (3,1), I can work through the middle section systematically.

Let me trace a potential path from (5,1): (5,1) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3

2025-12-10 20:18:06,305 - INFO - THINKING:

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- Current position: (4,1)
- Progress: 18/36 cells filled, so 18 cells remaining
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) - started there
- I've already visited clue 2 at (4,5) - that was step 12
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining 18 empty cells
- Available moves: (3,1), (5,1), (4,0)

**2. STRATEGY:**
Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal is to complete a Hamiltonian path through all remaining empty cells. I need to be careful not to trap myself or leave isolated cells unreachable.

Let me identify the empty cells remaining:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

That's 18 empty cells - perfect!

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

**(3,1) - Moving UP:**
- This would take me into the middle-left area
- From (3,1), I'd have access to (3,0), (3,2), (2,1)
- This keeps many options open

**(5,1) - Moving DOWN:**
- This would take me to the bottom row
- From (5,1), I'd only be able to go to (5,0) - a dead end with only 2 cells
- This would trap me in the bottom-left corner too early
- Bad choice - would leave 16 cells unreachable

**(4,0) - Moving LEFT:**
- This would take me to the leftmost column
- From (4,0), I could go to (3,0) or (5,0)
- If I go to (4,0), I'd need to carefully navigate the left side
- This might work but seems restrictive

**4. DECISION:**

Move (5,1) is clearly bad - it would trap me with only 2 cells accessible.

Between (3,1) and (4,0), I need to think about connectivity:
- If I go to (3,1), I can work through the middle rows systematically
- If I go to (4,0), I'm forced to the edge immediately

Going to (3,1) allows me to sweep through rows 3, 2, and 1 more naturally, then come back down the left side to finish at (5,0) or (5,1).

The best approach is to move UP to (3,1), which keeps maximum flexibility and allows me to fill the large empty area in rows 1-3 before finishing with the bottom-left corner.

- **(2,1)**: This moves up to row 2. From (2,1), I could access (2,0), (2,2), and (1,1). This would allow me to work through row 2 and potentially connect to row 1.

- **(3,0)**: This moves left to the leftmost column. From (3,0), I could only move to (2,0) or (4,0). This could potentially trap me in the left column without being able to reach all cells.

- **(3,2)**: This moves right. From (3,2), I could access (2,2), (3,3), or potentially back but that's already visited. This gives access to the middle-right area.

Let me think about the path coverage:
- If I go to (3,0), I'd be in the corner and would need to go up to (2,0) or down to (4,0). The left column cells (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0) need to be visited.
- If I go to (2,1), I can access row 2 which has many empty cells and then work my way to row 1 and eventually to the left column.
- If I go to (3,2), I'd be working in the middle area first.

4. DECISION:
I should go to **(2,1)** because:
- It gives me access to a large section of empty cells in row 2
- From (2,1), I can systematically work through row 2 (moving to (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), then across row 2)
- This approach allows me to fill the upper-left section efficiently without getting trapped
- It maintains connectivity to all remaining empty cells

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

**1. ANALYSIS: Current Situation**
- Current position: (2,1)
- Filled: 20/36 cells (16 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I've completed all required clue visits
- Now I need to fill the remaining 16 empty cells in one continuous path

**2. STRATEGY: Path Completion**
Since I've visited both clues (1 and 2), my goal is to visit all remaining empty cells exactly once without getting trapped. Let me identify the empty cells:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,2), (3,3)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

That's 16 empty cells, which matches what I need to fill.

**3. EVALUATION: Available Moves**
From (2,1), I can move to:
- **(1,1)**: Upper cell
- **(2,0)**: Left cell
- **(2,2)**: Right cell

Let me analyze each option for potential dead-ends:

**Option A: (1,1)**
- This moves up into row 1
- From (1,1), I could access (1,0), (1,2) 
- Row 1 has 3 empty cells: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- If I go to (1,1), I need to carefully plan to avoid getting trapped in row 1

**Option B: (2,0)**
- This moves left to the edge
- From (2,0), I can only go to (1,0) or (3,0)
- This is a corner position which could be risky
- If I go here now, I need a clear path back

**Option C: (2,2)**
- This moves right
- From (2,2), I can access (1,2), (2,3), (3,2)
- This keeps me in the middle area with more flexibility
- Row 2 has many empty cells to fill: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)

Let me think about the overall path strategy. I need to avoid creating isolated regions. Looking at the board:
- The left column (column 0) has empty cells at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
- Row 1 has (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- The middle area has several cells

If I go to (2,2), I can sweep through row 2 to the right, then work my way through other areas systematically. This seems safest.

**4. DECISION:**
Move to **(2,2)** because:
1. It maintains flexibility with multiple exit options
2. It allows me to complete row 2's empty cells systematically
3. It avoids getting trapped in corner positions
4. From there, I can plan a path that sweeps through the remaining cells efficiently

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,2)
- Cells filled: 21/36 (15 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I've completed all required clue visits
- Now I need to fill the remaining 15 empty cells to complete the puzzle

2. CURRENT SITUATION:
Looking at the visual board, the empty cells are:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,2), (3,3)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

Total: 15 empty cells remaining (matches 36 - 21 = 15)

3. AVAILABLE MOVES FROM (2,2):
- (1,2) - Move up
- (3,2) - Move down
- (2,3) - Move right

4. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,2) - Going UP
- This moves into the upper-left region
- From (1,2), I could access (1,1), (1,0), and potentially (2,3)
- If I go up here, I need to ensure I can still reach all cells in the lower-left corner (rows 3-5, columns 0-1)
- The lower-left region (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1) forms a connected area
- Risk: Could potentially isolate the bottom-left cells

Option B: Move to (3,2) - Going DOWN
- Already visited: (3,1) is at position [19], (4,2) is at position [17]
- (3,2) is empty and connects to the lower region
- From (3,2), I could move to (3,3) or back toward (3,0)
- This keeps me connected to the lower-left region

Option C: Move to (2,3) - Going RIGHT
- Moves into the middle-right area
- Empty cells at (2,3) and (2,4) need to be visited
- From (2,3), I can go to (2,4), (3,3), or (1,3) - but (1,3) is already visited
- This might be premature as it could isolate the left side

5. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:
I need to ensure I can reach all remaining cells. The most challenging area appears to be the bottom-left corner: (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1). 

If I move to (3,2), I maintain better access to sweep through the lower region systematically, then work my way up to finish the upper-left area.

The optimal path strategy seems to be:
- Go down to (3,2)
- Continue to explore and fill the middle/lower areas
- Then sweep back to fill the remaining upper and left regions

- From (2,3), I can go to (2,4), (3,3), or (1,3) - but (1,3) is already visited
- This might be premature as it could isolate the left side

5. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:
I need to ensure I can reach all remaining cells. The most challenging area appears to be the bottom-left corner: (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1). 

If I move to (3,2), I maintain better access to sweep through the lower region systematically, then work my way up to finish the upper-left area.

The optimal path strategy seems to be:
- Go down to (3,2)
- Continue to explore and fill the middle/lower areas
- Then sweep back to fill the remaining upper and left regions

2025-12-10 20:19:38,745 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **CURRENT POSITION**: I'm at (3,3) with 23/36 cells filled, meaning I have 13 cells left to visit.

2. **CLUES COMPLETED**: I've visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5). Both clues are done, so now I just need to fill the remaining empty cells.

3. **AVAILABLE MOVES**: 
   - (2,3) - moves up
   - (4,3) - moves down  
   - (3,4) - moves right

4. **REMAINING EMPTY CELLS**: Let me identify which cells are still empty:
   - Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
   - Row 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)
   - Row 3: (3,0), (3,4)
   - Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
   - Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

   That's 13 empty cells, which matches 36-23=13.

5. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS**: 
   - I need to create a path that visits all remaining cells without getting trapped.
   - The left side of the board (column 0) has several unvisited cells: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1)
   - The middle section has: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4)

6. **EVALUATING EACH MOVE**:

   **Option A: (3,4)** - Move right
   - This moves toward the right side
   - From (3,4), I could access (2,4), (4,4)
   - This could lead to a path: (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> ... 
   - Need to ensure I can reach all cells in the left column afterward

   **Option B: (4,3)** - Move down
   - This goes down to row 4
   - From (4,3), I can access (4,4) or (4,0)
   - Path could be: (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> ...

   **Option C: (2,3)** - Move up
   - This goes up to row 2
   - From (2,3), I can access (2,4) or (1,3) is already visited
   - Path: (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> ... -> (5,1) -> (5,0)

Let me trace option C more carefully:
(2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> ... but where from (1,2)? I need to get to (5,0) and (5,1) still.

Actually, let me think about this differently. I need to ensure I can visit all the remaining cells. The tricky part is the left column which has many unvisited cells that form a potential dead-end.

The safest approach is to move to (2,3), then work my way through the upper-middle area, then sweep down the left side to finish at (5,0) or (5,1).

   - From (2,3), I could reach (2,4), (1,3) [already visited], or (2,2) [already visited]
   - This would allow me to potentially fill (2,3) -> (2,4) -> ...
   
b) (4,3) - Moving DOWN:
   - This cell is empty and needs to be filled
   - From (4,3), I could reach (4,4), (4,2) [already visited], (3,3) [current], or (5,3) [already visited]
   - This leads to (4,4) and then I'd need to navigate carefully
   
c) (3,4) - Moving RIGHT:
   - This cell is empty and needs to be filled
   - From (3,4), I could reach (2,4), (4,4), (3,5) [already visited], or (3,3) [current]
   - This connects to the upper-right area

4. STRATEGIC THINKING:
I need to visit all remaining 13 cells. Let me think about connectivity:
- The left side has a column of empty cells: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
- Row 1 has (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) empty
- I need to ensure I can reach all areas without getting trapped

If I go to (3,4), I can access (2,4) and (4,4), which are in the right-middle area.
If I go to (2,3), I can access (2,4) from there.
If I go to (4,3), I can access (4,4).

Let me trace a potential path:
- Go RIGHT to (3,4) -> UP to (2,4) -> UP to (2,3) -> LEFT to (2,0) -> DOWN to (3,0) -> DOWN to (4,0) -> DOWN to (5,0) -> RIGHT to (5,1) -> UP to (4,1) [visited] - NO, this won't work

Let me try: (3,4) -> DOWN to (4,4) -> DOWN to (5,4) [visited] - blocked

Better path: (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (5,1) -> (5,0)
Wait, I need to check connectivity more carefully.

Actually, going to (2,3) first allows me to fill the upper area and then work my way down and left to fill the remaining cells on the left column.

2025-12-10 20:19:58,600 - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,3)
- Cells filled: 23/36, so 13 cells remaining
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining empty cells
- Available moves: (2,3), (4,3), (3,4)

2. CURRENT BOARD STATE:
Looking at the visual board, the empty cells (marked with '.') are:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,3), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

That's 13 empty cells, which matches 36 - 23 = 13 remaining.

3. EVALUATION OF MOVES:
From (3,3), I can move to:

a) (2,3) - Moving UP:
   - This cell is empty and needs to be filled

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,3)
- Progress: 24/36 cells filled, so 12 cells remain
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining 12 empty cells
- Available move: (2,4)

Looking at the visual board, the empty cells are:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), I need to create a continuous path that visits all remaining empty cells exactly once. The path must be continuous with no dead ends until all 36 cells are filled.

3. EVALUATION:
From (2,3), I can only move to (2,4) according to the available moves. Let me verify this makes sense:
- (2,4) is currently empty (shown as . in the visual)
- Moving to (2,4) keeps the path continuous
- From (2,4), I would be able to continue to adjacent empty cells

Let me trace what happens after (2,4):
- From (2,4), I could move to (3,4) or (1,4) - but (1,4) is already visited [6]
- So from (2,4), I must go to (3,4)
- From (3,4), I could go to (4,4)
- From (4,4), I could go to (4,3)
- From (4,3), I need to continue to fill remaining cells in rows 1, 4, and 5

This path should allow me to snake through the remaining empty cells and complete the puzzle.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (2,4) is the only available option and it's the correct move. It maintains path continuity and allows access to the remaining empty cells in a logical sequence.

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,4)
- Cells filled: 25/36, so 11 cells remain
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest clue, I've already completed all required clue visits
- Now I need to fill the remaining 11 empty cells to complete the puzzle

Looking at the visual board, the empty cells (marked with '.') are:
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- (3,0)
- (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- (5,0), (5,1)

And one more at (3,4) which is adjacent to my current position.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've visited all clues, my goal is to create a path that visits all remaining empty cells without creating dead ends or isolated regions.

3. EVALUATION:
From (2,4), my only available move is (3,4).

Let me check if (3,4) is a valid move:
- (3,4) is currently empty
- It's adjacent to my current position (2,4)
- It hasn't been visited yet

After moving to (3,4), I'll need to plan a path to cover:
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- (3,0)
- (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- (5,0), (5,1)

From (3,4), I can move to:
- (3,5) - already visited
- (4,4) - empty, this would let me continue to (4,3), then (4,0), then down to (5,0), (5,1), back up through (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) - this looks promising!

4. DECISION:
(3,4) is my only available move, and it's a necessary step. This move allows me to enter the lower-right empty region and then sweep through the remaining empty cells on the left side of the board.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **Current Position**: (3,4)
2. **Progress**: 26/36 cells filled, so 10 cells remain
3. **Clues visited**: Started at clue 1 (0,0), reached clue 2 (4,5) at step 12
4. **Available move**: Only (4,4) is listed

Let me visualize what cells are still empty:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 3: (3,0)
- Row 4: (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

That's 9 empty cells, plus my current position makes 10 cells left to visit.

From (3,4), the only available adjacent cell that hasn't been visited is (4,4).

Let me trace what happens if I go to (4,4):
- From (4,4), I could go to:
  - (4,3) - empty
  - (5,4) - already visited at step 14
  - (3,4) - current position, can't revisit
  - (4,5) - already visited (clue 2)

So from (4,4), I would need to go to (4,3).

From (4,3), I could go to:
- (4,2) - already visited
- (4,4) - would be just visited
- (3,3) - already visited
- (5,3) - already visited

This creates a problem! If I go (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3), I would be trapped with no valid moves.

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the remaining cells:
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (3,0), (4,0), (4,3), (4,4), (5,0), (5,1)

I need to find a path that visits all these cells. From (3,4), if (4,4) is the only available move, I must take it, but I need to ensure the path can continue and eventually reach all remaining cells.

Actually, since only (4,4) is listed as available, this must be the valid move. The puzzle wouldn't give me a move that makes it unsolvable. Let me trust the constraint and plan ahead:

After (4,4), I'll need to navigate through (4,3), then likely work my way to collect the remaining cells in rows 1, 3, 4, and 5.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- I am currently at position (4,3)
- I have filled 28 out of 36 cells, meaning 8 cells remain empty
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Since clue 2 is the highest clue, I've completed all required clues
- Now I just need to fill the remaining 8 empty cells to complete the puzzle

Looking at the visual board, the empty cells (marked with '.') are:
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- (2,0)
- (3,0)
- (4,0)
- (5,0), (5,1)

2. STRATEGY:
Since all clues have been visited, my goal is to create a path that visits all 8 remaining empty cells without getting stuck. The empty cells form a mostly connected region on the left side of the board.

3. EVALUATION:
From my current position (4,3), I can only move to adjacent cells that haven't been visited:
- Up to (3,3): Already visited (step 23)
- Down to (5,3): Already visited (step 15)
- Left to (4,2): Already visited (step 17)
- Right to (4,4): Already visited (step 27)

Wait, the puzzle says "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" - let me verify this is actually stuck or if there's a valid continuation.

Looking at my path more carefully at position (4,3):
- All four adjacent cells have been visited
- This means I am indeed stuck

However, let me reconsider if this is truly the case. Let me trace back to see if there was an error in understanding the current position or if we need to identify where the path went wrong.

Looking at the filled cells and the path, position (4,3) is surrounded by:
- (3,3): visited at step 23
- (5,3): visited at step 15
- (4,2): visited at step 17
- (4,4): visited at step 27

All adjacent cells are indeed visited. The puzzle is in a stuck state.

4. DECISION:
Since the puzzle is genuinely stuck with no valid moves from position (4,3), I need to report that the current path has led to an unsolvable situation. The remaining 8 cells cannot be reached from this position.

The issue appears to be that the path isolated the empty cells on the left side (column 0 and some of row 1) from the current position. To solve this puzzle successfully, an earlier move would need to be different to ensure all cells remain reachable.

MOVE: Unable to move - puzzle is stuck. No valid adjacent cells available from (4,3).

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:21:35,454 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (4,3)
- Cells filled: 28/36
- Remaining cells: 8

**Remaining empty cells:**
Looking at the visual board:
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) - Row 1, left side
- (2,0) - Row 2, left corner
- (3,0) - Row 3, left corner
- (4,0) - Row 4, left corner
- (5,0), (5,1) - Row 5, left side

That's 8 empty cells, which matches the remaining count.

**Available moves from (4,3):**
- Up: (3,3) - Already visited [23]
- Down: (5,3) - Already visited [15]
- Left: (4,2) - Already visited [17]
- Right: (4,4) - Already visited [27]

Wait, the puzzle says "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" - let me verify this.

All four adjacent cells from (4,3) have been visited:
- (3,3) = step 23
- (5,3) = step 15
- (4,2) = step 17
- (4,4) = step 27

This appears to be an impossible situation. However, let me re-examine the path to see if there's an error in the given path.

Looking at the path sequence and board state:
- The path has boxed itself in at (4,3)
- All 4 adjacent cells have been visited
- There are still 8 cells to visit (the entire left column essentially)

**The Problem:**
The given path has created a situation where we're trapped. The path visited the right and bottom portions of the board first, then came back through the middle, but didn't leave a way to reach the remaining 8 cells in the left portion of the board (column 0 and some of column 1).

This appears to be an **unsolvable state** from the current position. The path planning earlier in the puzzle cut off access to the left side of the board.

However, since I must provide a move, let me check if there's any interpretation error...

Actually, reviewing the rules: we can only move to adjacent unvisited cells. Since all adjacent cells to (4,3) have been visited, there is genuinely **no valid move** from this position.

The puzzle is in an unsolvable state. The error occurred earlier in the path when the route didn't preserve connectivity to all remaining cells.

MOVE: None - The puzzle is unsolvable from this position. All adjacent cells to (4,3) have already been visited, and 8 cells remain unreachable.

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,3)
- Cells filled: 28/36
- Cells remaining: 8
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,0) and clue 2 at (4,5)
- Looking at the visual board, the empty cells (marked with '.') are:
  - (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
  - (3,0)
  - (4,0)
  - (5,0), (5,1)

2. CURRENT SITUATION:
From position (4,3), my available moves are:
- Up to (3,3) - already visited [23]
- Down to (5,3) - already visited [15]
- Left to (4,2) - already visited [17]
- Right to (4,4) - already visited [27]

Wait, the prompt says "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" but let me verify this is truly the case.

Looking at my current position (4,3) which is step [28]:
- (3,3) = [23] - visited
- (5,3) = [15] - visited
- (4,2) = [17] - visited
- (4,4) = [27] - visited

All four adjacent cells have been visited. This confirms I am indeed stuck.

3. ANALYSIS OF THE PATH:
Looking at the remaining empty cells, they form a disconnected region in the left side of the board:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)
- Row 3: (3,0)
- Row 4: (4,0)
- Row 5: (5,0), (5,1)

These 8 empty cells are isolated from my current position (4,3) because all paths to reach them have been blocked by already-visited cells.

4. CONCLUSION:
This is an impossible situation. The puzzle has reached a dead-end state where I cannot continue. The path planning earlier created a situation where the remaining 8 cells in the leftmost columns cannot be reached without revisiting already-visited cells.

The error occurred in the earlier path choices - specifically, the path should have been designed to avoid isolating the left side of the board. The snake pattern should have incorporated those left columns earlier in the path rather than leaving them disconnected.

MOVE: Unable to continue - puzzle is in an unsolvable state from current position. No valid moves available.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,0)
- Cells filled: 2/36
- Path so far: (0,0) [Clue 1] -> (1,0)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (2,0)
- Available moves: (2,0) and (1,1)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to visit Clue 2 next, which is at position (2,0). This is directly below my current position at (1,0).

3. EVALUATION:
Option A: Move to (2,0)
- PROS: This directly reaches Clue 2, which is my required next destination
- PROS: Follows the rule of visiting clues in ascending order
- PROS: Keeps me on the left edge, allowing flexibility to explore the rest of the board
- CONS: None significant - this is the required move

Option B: Move to (1,1)
- PROS: Moves toward the center of the board
- CONS: Takes me away from Clue 2, which I must visit next
- CONS: Would require backtracking or a longer path to reach (2,0)
- CONS: Could create path complications since I must visit (2,0) before continuing

4. DECISION:
The choice is clear: I must move to (2,0) to reach Clue 2. According to the puzzle rules, I must visit all clues in ascending order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5), and since I've visited Clue 1, Clue 2 at (2,0) is my mandatory next destination. Moving to (1,1) would violate the efficient path requirement and potentially create unnecessary complications.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,0) - which is Clue 2
- Path taken: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) [3 cells filled out of 36]
- Next clue to visit: Clue 3 at position (4,5)
- Available moves: (3,0) or (2,1)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to reach Clue 3 at (4,5) from my current position (2,0)
- The distance is significant: 2 rows down and 5 columns right
- I have 33 more cells to fill before reaching (4,5)
- After Clue 3, I need to visit Clue 4 at (4,0), then Clue 5 at (5,0)

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (3,0) - Going DOWN
- Pros: Moves me one row closer to (4,5)
- Cons: Keeps me in the leftmost column, far from the target column (5)
- This would continue hugging the left edge, which might make it harder to efficiently cover the board

Option B: Move to (2,1) - Going RIGHT
- Pros: Starts moving toward the right side of the board where Clue 3 is located
- Opens up the interior of the board for path planning
- Allows more flexibility in creating a path that can snake through all cells
- Cons: Doesn't move me vertically closer to row 4

4. DECISION:
Given that I need to:
- Visit all 36 cells in a continuous path
- Reach (4,5) eventually
- Then return to (4,0) and (5,0)

Moving to (2,1) is the better choice because:
- I'm currently in column 0, and Clue 3 is in column 5 - I need to start moving right
- If I continue down to (3,0), I'll be trapped in the left column too long
- Moving right gives me access to the interior cells and allows for a more efficient snake pattern
- I can create a path that weaves through the board, gradually working toward (4,5)
- This maintains better flexibility for covering all cells

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:23:22,020 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (2,3)
- Progress: 6/36 cells filled
- Path so far: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3)
- Clues visited: 1 at (0,0) and 2 at (2,0)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 3 at position (4,5)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to reach clue 3 at (4,5) next
- From (2,3), clue 3 is 2 rows down and 2 columns to the right
- I need to navigate there while filling cells and not blocking future paths

3. EVALUATION of available moves:
   
   a) (1,3) - Moving UP:
      - Takes me away from clue 3 (which is down and right)
      - Would require backtracking later
      - Not optimal for reaching clue 3
   
   b) (3,3) - Moving DOWN:
      - Moves me closer to clue 3 (correct direction vertically)
      - Still need to move right eventually to reach (4,5)
      - Good progress toward the goal
   
   c) (2,4) - Moving RIGHT:
      - Moves me closer to clue 3 (correct direction horizontally)
      - Gets me to column 4, only 1 column away from clue 3
      - From (2,4), I could continue building a path toward (4,5)

4. DECISION:
Looking at the board layout and remaining cells:
- Moving to (2,4) puts me at row 2, column 4
- From there, I can continue right to (2,5), then work my way down to eventually reach (4,5)
- This move keeps me on track horizontally and doesn't waste moves
- Moving down to (3,3) would be okay, but I still need to go right, and (2,4) is more direct

However, I need to think about the overall path. After visiting clue 3 at (4,5), I need to reach clue 4 at (4,0) and then clue 5 at (5,0). This means after going to the right side of the board, I'll need to traverse back to the left side.

Given this, (2,4) seems like the right choice as it continues building a path that can snake through the board efficiently.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:23:49,344 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,5) and have filled 8 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

**Current Status:**
- Position: (2,5)
- Cells filled: 8/36
- Last clue visited: Clue 2 at (2,0)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 3 at (4,5)

**Clue Analysis:**
- Clue 3 is at (4,5) - I need to reach this next
- Clue 4 is at (4,0)
- Clue 5 is at (5,0)

**Available Moves:**
1. (1,5) - Move up to row 1
2. (3,5) - Move down to row 3

**Evaluation:**

**Option 1: Move to (1,5)**
- This moves me AWAY from Clue 3 at (4,5)
- I would be going up when I need to go down
- This would require me to later come back down, potentially wasting moves and creating path constraints
- Could lead to inefficient path usage

**Option 2: Move to (3,5)**
- This moves me TOWARD Clue 3 at (4,5)
- I'm at column 5, and Clue 3 is also at column 5
- Moving to (3,5) puts me one row away from (4,5)
- Direct path: (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) reaches Clue 3 efficiently
- This is the most logical progression

**Strategic Considerations:**
Since I'm already in column 5 and Clue 3 is at (4,5), staying in this column and moving down is the most efficient path. After visiting Clue 3, I'll need to navigate to Clue 4 at (4,0) and then Clue 5 at (5,0), so I'll need to fill the remaining cells strategically.

Moving to (3,5) is clearly the better choice as it:
1. Progresses toward the next required clue
2. Maintains efficiency in path planning
3. Doesn't create unnecessary detours

2. STRATEGY:
I need to visit Clue 3 next, which is at position (4,5). This is very close to my current position at (3,5).

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (3,5):
- (4,5): This is exactly where Clue 3 is located! This would be perfect as I need to visit this clue next.
- (3,4): This moves left, away from Clue 3. While it might allow me to explore other areas, I should prioritize reaching the next required clue.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,5) is the obvious choice because:
- It's the location of Clue 3, which I must visit next
- It continues the path requirement of visiting clues in ascending order
- After visiting Clue 3, I'll need to navigate to Clue 4 at (4,0) and then Clue 5 at (5,0)

- Next clues to visit: Clue 4 at (4,0) and Clue 5 at (5,0)
- Available moves: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to visit clue 4 at position (4,0) next
- Clue 4 is in the same row as my current position (4,4), but 4 columns to the left
- After clue 4, I need to reach clue 5 at (5,0), which is adjacent to clue 4
- I have 25 more cells to fill after this move

3. EVALUATION OF MOVES:

Option A: (3,4) - Moving up
- This takes me away from clue 4 (which is at row 4)
- Would require me to eventually come back down to row 4
- Could create inefficient path patterns

Option B: (5,4) - Moving down
- Takes me to row 5, closer to the final clue 5 at (5,0)
- From (5,4), I could move left along row 5 toward (5,0)
- However, I need to visit clue 4 at (4,0) BEFORE clue 5 at (5,0)
- This would make it difficult to reach clue 4 without backtracking

Option C: (4,3) - Moving left
- Stays on row 4, heading directly toward clue 4 at (4,0)
- This is the most direct path to the next required clue
- From (4,3), I can continue left to reach (4,2), (4,1), and finally (4,0) where clue 4 is
- After reaching clue 4, clue 5 is immediately adjacent at (5,0)

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,3) is the best choice because:
- It maintains progress toward the next required clue (clue 4)
- It keeps me on row 4, allowing efficient movement to (4,0)
- It doesn't create unnecessary detours
- After visiting clue 4 and 5, I'll still have the upper portion of the board (rows 0, 1, 3, and parts of row 5) to complete the remaining path

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:24:55,147 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze my current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,3)
- Progress: 12/36 cells filled
- Last clue visited: Clue 3 at (4,5)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 4 at (4,0)
- Then I need to reach: Clue 5 at (5,0)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to visit Clue 4 at position (4,0). From my current position (4,3), I need to move left along row 4 to reach it. After Clue 4, I must visit Clue 5 at (5,0), which is directly below Clue 4.

3. EVALUATION of available moves:
- (3,3): Moving UP to row 3. This takes me away from Clue 4 which is at (4,0). However, I have a lot of empty space in rows 0-1 and 3-5 that needs to be filled.
- (5,3): Moving DOWN to row 5. This also moves away from the direct path to Clue 4 at (4,0), but could be useful for filling cells.
- (4,2): Moving LEFT towards Clue 4. This gets me one step closer to (4,0) where Clue 4 is located.

Let me think about the path requirements:
- I need to reach (4,0) for Clue 4
- Then (5,0) for Clue 5 (the final clue)
- I have 24 more cells to fill (36 total - 12 filled)
- Most empty cells are in rows 0, 1, 3, and 5

If I go directly to Clue 4 via (4,2) then (4,1) then (4,0), I would be at Clue 4 in 3 moves. Then I'd move to (5,0) for Clue 5. But I'd still have many cells unfilled in the upper portion of the board.

Looking at the board, I see that rows 0, 1, 3, and most of row 5 are empty. I need a path that eventually covers all these cells.

If I move to (4,2), I continue toward Clue 4 directly, which seems efficient. From (4,2), I could go to (4,1), then (4,0) to hit Clue 4, then (5,0) for Clue 5. But then I'd be stuck at (5,0) with no way to fill the remaining cells in rows 0, 1, 3, and 5.

Better strategy: I should move in a way that allows me to fill more cells before reaching Clue 4. Let me consider (5,3) - moving down to row 5. This would let me traverse row 5, potentially fill more cells, and then reach Clue 4 and 5.

From (5,3), I could go to (5,2), then (5,1), but then I'd need to reach (4,0) and (5,0). This creates challenges.

Actually, moving to (4,2) and continuing left to Clue 4 makes sense, but I need to ensure I can fill all remaining cells after visiting Clue 5.

4. DECISION:
Move to (4,2) - this continues my path toward Clue 4 at (4,0). It's the most direct route to the next required clue, and I can plan the remaining path from there.

- From (4,1), I can reach (4,0) for clue 4, then (5,0) for clue 5
- After visiting clue 5, I'll need to fill the remaining cells, and this path keeps options open

2025-12-10 20:25:39,738 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **ANALYSIS**: 
   - Current position: (4,0) - This is where clue 4 is located
   - Progress: 15/36 cells filled
   - I've visited clues 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order
   - Next clue to visit: Clue 5 at position (5,0)
   - Available moves: (3,0) or (5,0)

2. **STRATEGY**:
   - I must visit clue 5 next, which is at (5,0)
   - After clue 5, I need to fill the remaining 21 cells (36 total - 15 already filled)
   - The unvisited cells are primarily in rows 0, 1, 3, and 5

3. **EVALUATION**:
   
   **Option A: Move to (3,0)**
   - Pros: Moves upward, could help fill column 0
   - Cons: This moves AWAY from clue 5 at (5,0). Since clue 5 is the final clue and must be reached, and (5,0) is only accessible from (4,0) currently (since (5,1) would need to be part of the path), moving to (3,0) first would require me to come back down. However, looking at the board, if I go to (3,0), I'd need to eventually come back to reach (5,0), which could create path complications.
   
   **Option B: Move to (5,0)**
   - Pros: Directly reaches clue 5, which is the next required clue and the final destination
   - Cons: Must ensure I can still fill all remaining cells after reaching the end clue
   
4. **DECISION**:
   
   Wait - I need to reconsider! Clue 5 is at (5,0), which is the LAST clue. This means (5,0) should be the FINAL position of my path, not the next move. Let me recalculate:
   
   - I'm at (4,0) which has clue 4
   - Clue 5 at (5,0) is the highest numbered clue
   - I need to END at clue 5, meaning it should be the 36th cell visited
   - I still need to fill 21 more cells before reaching (5,0)
   
   Therefore, I should move to (3,0) and save (5,0) for the very end of the path.
   
   Moving to (3,0) allows me to:
   - Continue building the path through the unvisited areas
   - Keep (5,0) as my final destination
   - Access the upper portions of the board that still need to be filled

2025-12-10 20:25:56,905 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,0)
- Progress: 16/36 cells filled (44% complete)
- Last clue visited: Clue 4 at (4,0) - step 15
- Next clue to visit: Clue 5 at (5,0)
- Only available move: (3,1)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to visit Clue 5 at position (5,0) next
- Currently at (3,0), which is 2 rows above (5,0)
- I have only one available move: (3,1)
- After moving to (3,1), I need to eventually reach (5,0)

3. EVALUATION:
Looking at the board, I can see:
- The only available move is (3,1)
- From (3,1), I'll need to navigate to reach (5,0) for Clue 5
- The left column has: (0,0)-visited, (1,0)-visited, (2,0)-visited, (3,0)-current, (4,0)-visited, (5,0)-Clue 5
- I need to create a path that reaches (5,0) and then fills the remaining 20 cells

Let me trace what happens if I move to (3,1):
- Move to (3,1) - this is the only option
- From (3,1), I can move to: (3,2), (4,1)-visited, or (2,1)-visited
- So from (3,1), I'd only be able to go to (3,2)
- This creates a path going right, away from (5,0)

Wait, let me reconsider the unfilled cells:
Row 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) - 4 cells
Row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) - 3 cells (note: (1,4) is filled as step 3)
Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) - 4 cells
Row 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) - 5 cells
Plus (5,0) which is Clue 5

Total unfilled: 4 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 17 cells, but we've filled 16, so 36-16 = 20 cells remain.

4. DECISION:
Since (3,1) is the only available move, I must take it. The challenge will be creating a path that:
- Eventually reaches (5,0) for Clue 5
- Fills all remaining cells
- Doesn't create dead ends

Moving to (3,1) allows me to continue building a path that can snake through row 3, potentially move up to rows 1 and 0, then come back down to row 5 to reach Clue 5 and fill the bottom row.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-12-10 20:26:17,339 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,1) and have filled 17 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

**Current Status:**
- I've already visited clues 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order
- Next clue to visit: Clue 5 at position (5,0)
- Current position: (3,1)
- Available move: (3,2)

**Path Analysis:**
Looking at the visual board, I can see:
- Row 0: Only position (0,0) is filled (clue 1). Positions (0,1) through (0,5) are empty except (0,5).
- Row 1: Only position (1,0) is filled. Positions (1,1) through (1,5) need to be visited.
- Row 2: Completely filled (positions 2,0 through 2,5)
- Row 3: Positions (3,0) and (3,1) are filled. Position (3,2) is available. Positions (3,3), (3,4) are empty, (3,5) is filled.
- Row 4: Completely filled (positions 4,0 through 4,5)
- Row 5: Only position (5,0) is filled (clue 5). Positions (5,1) through (5,5) are empty.

**Strategic Consideration:**
I need to reach clue 5 at (5,0), but I still have 19 cells left to fill (36 - 17 = 19).

The remaining empty cells are:
- Row 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) [4 cells, (0,5) seems filled based on legend]
- Row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) [5 cells]
- Row 3: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) [3 cells]
- Row 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) [5 cells]

Wait, let me recount based on the visual:
Row 0: [ 1] . . . . 2 - positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) are empty (4 cells)
Row 1: [ 2] 4 . . 3 . - This shows path positions, not clues. Looking at legend, positions (1,2), (1,3) are empty, and (1,5) is empty (3 cells)
Actually, let me reinterpret the visual more carefully.

Row 1 shows: [ 2] 4 . . 3 .
The [2] means it's the 2nd step in path at (1,0). The "4" and "3" appear to be step numbers too, not clues.

Let me reconsider: From the path taken, position (1,4) had step 3. So Row 1 should be:
(1,0)=step 2, (1,1)=step 4... 

Actually, I need to map the path more carefully. But the key point is: I'm at (3,1) with only one available move to (3,2).

**Decision:**
Since (3,2) is the only available move and I need to continue filling the board to eventually reach clue 5 at (5,0), I must move to (3,2). This keeps my path continuous and allows me to potentially navigate through the remaining empty cells in rows 0, 1, 3, and 5 before ending at clue 5.

2025-12-10 20:26:39,785 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,2)
- Cells filled: 18/36 (exactly half)
- Last clue visited: Clue 4 at (4,0) - visited at step 15
- Next clue to visit: Clue 5 at (5,0)
- Available move: Only (3,3)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to visit Clue 5 at (5,0) next and last (it's the highest numbered clue)
- Currently at (3,2), and I have only one available move: (3,3)
- After reaching (5,0), I must have visited all 36 cells
- I need to fill 18 more cells, and the remaining empty cells are:
  - Row 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) - 5 cells (but (0,5) is marked as 2, so 4 empty)
  - Row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) - 5 cells (but (1,4) is marked as 3, so 4 empty)
  - Row 3: (3,3), (3,4) - 2 cells
  - Row 5: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) - 5 cells (but (5,2) and (5,4) are marked, so 3 empty)
  
Wait, let me recount the empty cells from the visual board:
- Row 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) - 4 cells
- Row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5) - 4 cells  
- Row 3: (3,3), (3,4) - 2 cells
- Row 5: (5,1), (5,3), (5,5) - 3 cells
Total empty: 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 13 cells, plus we need to reach (5,0) for clue 5 = 14 cells
But we need 18 more cells (36 - 18 = 18)

Let me recount from the board state more carefully... Actually, looking at row 5, positions with numbers like "12", "10", "9" appear to be clue markers, not path positions. Let me reconsider:
- (5,0) = Clue 5 (marked as "12" but that seems wrong based on clue locations)

Actually, reviewing the visual board legend again, I see there might be confusion. Let me trust the clue locations given:
- Clue 5 is at (5,0)

3. EVALUATION:
Since only (3,3) is available as the next move, I have no choice. However, I need to think about the path after this move:
- From (3,3), I can potentially move to (2,3), (3,4), or (4,3)
- But (2,3) is already visited (step 6)
- And (4,3) is already visited (step 12)
- So from (3,3), I'll only be able to go to (3,4)

This creates a path: (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> ...
From (3,4), I could go to (2,4) [already visited], (3,5) [already visited], or (3,3) [will be visited], so I'd need to go upward to (2,4) - wait, that's visited. Let me check (3,4)'s neighbors again after reaching it.

4. DECISION:
Since (3,3) is the only available move, I must take it. This will help me continue building the path toward eventually reaching (5,0) for Clue 5.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:27:53,031 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,4) and have filled 20 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. **Current Status**: I've visited clues 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order. The next clue I need to visit is clue 5 at position (5,0).

2. **Available Moves from (3,4)**: 
   - (3,3) - Already visited [19]
   - (3,5) - Already visited [9]
   - (2,4) - Already visited [7]
   - (4,4) - Already visited [11]
   
   Wait, all adjacent cells have been visited! This means I'm stuck.

3. **Problem Analysis**: Looking at the board, I can see that I've created a situation where I'm trapped at (3,4). All four adjacent cells have already been visited in my path. This is a dead-end situation.

4. **Reviewing the Path**: The issue occurred when I created a closed loop pattern. After reaching clue 3 at (4,5), I went through row 4 to reach clue 4 at (4,0), then moved up to (3,0) and across row 3 to (3,4). This left me with no way to continue.

5. **Remaining Cells**: I still need to fill 16 more cells (36 - 20 = 16) and reach clue 5 at (5,0). The unfilled cells are:
   - Row 0: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)
   - Row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)
   - Row 5: (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), plus (5,2) and (5,0) which is clue 5

This is a stuck position - I cannot make any valid moves from here because all adjacent cells have already been visited. The puzzle needs to be restarted or backtracked to an earlier position to find an alternative path.

MOVE: None - Position is stuck. Need to backtrack and find alternative path from an earlier decision point.

However, if I must provide a move in the required format, I cannot, as there are no legal moves available from position (3,4). All four adjacent cells [(2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5)] have already been visited in the path.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:28:08,584 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,3) - this is clue 1 (starting point)
- Filled: 1/36 cells
- Next target: Clue 2 at position (5,4)
- Subsequent clues: Clue 3 at (5,5), Clue 4 at (3,5)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to reach clue 2 at (5,4). From (3,3) to (5,4), I need to move:
- 2 rows down (from row 3 to row 5)
- 1 column right (from column 3 to column 4)

The path must eventually visit all 36 cells, so I need to be careful not to trap myself or cut off sections of the board.

3. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

Move (2,3) - Up:
- Takes me away from clue 2 (which is down and right)
- Opens up the upper portion of the board
- Could be useful for covering the top area before going to clue 2
- Might allow better coverage of all cells

Move (4,3) - Down:
- Moves me closer to clue 2 (row 5)
- Still in the same column, would need to move right later
- Keeps me on a direct path toward clue 2

Move (3,2) - Left:
- Takes me away from clue 2 (which is down and right)
- Opens up the left portion of the board
- Could help cover the western cells

Move (3,4) - Right:
- Moves me closer to clue 2 (column 4)
- Still need to move down 2 rows
- Directly approaches the target column

4. DECISION:
Since I need to visit ALL 36 cells and the clues form a pattern (1 at (3,3), 2 at (5,4), 3 at (5,5), 4 at (3,5)), I notice that clues 2, 3, and 4 are in the bottom-right area. 

If I go directly to clue 2, I might trap myself and be unable to cover all cells. Instead, I should first explore the upper and left portions of the board, then snake my way down to clue 2.

Moving to (2,3) allows me to explore the upper portion of the board first, which gives me more flexibility to create a continuous path that covers all 36 cells before reaching the clues in the bottom-right corner.

**1. ANALYSIS: Current Situation**
- Current position: (2,3)

- Path so far: Started at clue 1 (3,3), moved to (2,3)
- Next target: Clue 2 at position (5,4)
- Available moves: (1,3), (2,2), (2,4)

**2. STRATEGY: Next Clue Target**
I need to visit clue 2 at (5,4), then clue 3 at (5,5), and finally clue 4 at (3,5).

The clues form a pattern:
- Clue 1: (3,3) - DONE
- Clue 2: (5,4) - NEXT TARGET
- Clue 3: (5,5) - Adjacent to clue 2
- Clue 4: (3,5) - On the right edge

**3. EVALUATION: Available Moves**

Option A: (1,3) - Move UP
- Distance to clue 2: From (1,3) to (5,4) = 4 rows down + 1 column right = 5 steps minimum
- Pros: Opens up the top area of the board
- Cons: Moves AWAY from clue 2 (which is at row 5). This would require backtracking through many cells

Option B: (2,2) - Move LEFT
- Distance to clue 2: From (2,2) to (5,4) = 3 rows down + 2 columns right = 5 steps minimum
- Pros: Opens up the left side
- Cons: Also moves away from clue 2, and creates potential dead-end issues

Option C: (2,4) - Move RIGHT
- Distance to clue 2: From (2,4) to (5,4) = 3 rows down + 0 columns = 3 steps minimum
- Pros: Moves toward the right column where clues 2, 3, and 4 are located. Aligns us vertically with clue 2.
- Cons: None significant - this is the most direct path

**4. DECISION:**

Move (2,4) is clearly the best choice because:
1. It moves us closer to clue 2 at (5,4) by aligning us in the same column
2. It positions us near the right edge where clues 2, 3, and 4 are all located
3. We can work our way down the right side, visit the clues in order, and then fill in the remaining cells
4. Moving up (1,3) or left (2,2) would take us away from all remaining clues and waste precious path cells

The optimal strategy appears to be: move right to align with the clue column, then work down toward clue 2, ensuring we fill all 36 cells efficiently.

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**

**Strategic Analysis:**
I need to reach clue 2 at (5,4). From (2,4), that's 3 rows down. Let me evaluate each option:

**Option 1: (1,4) - Move UP**
- This takes me away from clue 2 (which is below me)
- I'd be moving in the opposite direction
- Would require backtracking later
- Not ideal

**Option 2: (3,4) - Move DOWN**
- This moves me closer to clue 2 at (5,4)
- Direct path: (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (5,4) would be 3 moves to reach clue 2
- This seems like the most direct approach

- Clue 3 is at (5,5) and clue 4 is at (3,5)
- However, I need to visit clue 2 first (at 5,4) before clue 3 (at 5,5)
- This could potentially trap me or make the path more complicated

2. It maintains flexibility for visiting all cells
3. It doesn't risk creating isolated regions

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:29:13,073 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,4)
- Cells filled: 5/36
- Path so far: (3,3)[1] -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4)[5]
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (5,4)
- Available moves: (5,4), (4,3), (4,5)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to visit clue 2 at (5,4) next, then clue 3 at (5,5), and finally clue 4 at (3,5)
- After visiting all clues, I still need to fill 36 - 4 = 32 additional cells in total (currently at 5, so 31 more to go)

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (5,4) - This is clue 2!
- PROS: This directly visits the next required clue
- CONS: Need to check if this allows me to complete the entire puzzle afterward
- From (5,4), I can reach (5,5) which is clue 3
- From (5,5), I need to eventually reach (3,5) which is clue 4
- This seems premature - I've only filled 5 cells and there are 36 total. If I rush to clue 2 now, I'll have limited path options

Option B: Move to (4,3)
- PROS: Moves left, creating more path before reaching clue 2
- CONS: Takes me away from clue 2 temporarily
- This gives me flexibility to fill more cells before committing to the clue sequence

Option C: Move to (4,5)
- PROS: Moves right toward the edge
- CONS: This corner area (4,5) -> (5,5) is where clues 2 and 3 are located. If I go here now, I might box myself in

Let me think about the bigger picture:
- I have 31 more cells to fill after this move
- Clues 2, 3, and 4 are all on the right side of the board (columns 4-5)
- I need to ensure I can create a path that visits ALL 36 cells

The key insight: If I go directly to (5,4) now, I'll be forced to go to (5,5) next (clue 3), but then I'll have only filled 7 cells out of 36. I need to visit clue 4 at (3,5) last, which means I need to fill 29 more cells between clue 3 and clue 4!

This suggests I should NOT rush to clue 2. Instead, I should build a longer path first.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,3) allows me to:
- Explore the left side of the board
- Build a longer path before committing to the clue sequence
- Maintain flexibility for covering all 36 cells

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:29:38,309 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (5,3)
- Cells filled: 7/36
- Path so far: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (5,3)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (5,4)

**Available Moves:**
1. (5,2) - Moving left
2. (5,4) - Moving right

**Analysis of Each Move:**

**Option 1: Move to (5,2)**
- This moves me AWAY from clue 2 at (5,4)
- I would need to eventually come back to reach (5,4), which could create path complications
- This would use up valuable cells on row 5 unnecessarily before visiting clue 2
- Since clue 2 is at (5,4) and I must visit it next, moving away doesn't make strategic sense

**Option 2: Move to (5,4) - Clue 2**
- This directly reaches clue 2, which is my next required destination
- From (5,4), I can then move to (5,5) which is clue 3 - the next clue in sequence
- This follows the puzzle requirement of visiting clues in ascending order
- This is the most efficient path progression

**Strategic Consideration:**
The puzzle requires visiting clues in order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4. I've already visited clue 1. Clue 2 is adjacent to my current position at (5,4). After reaching clue 2, clue 3 is at (5,5), which would be directly adjacent. This creates a natural flow: (5,3) -> (5,4) [clue 2] -> (5,5) [clue 3], then I can work my way to clue 4 at (3,5).

Moving to (5,2) would be counterproductive as it takes me away from the required clue sequence and could create unnecessary complications in completing the full path later.

I am currently at position (4,5) and have filled 10 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

- Next clue to visit: Clue 4 at position (3,5)
- Current position: (4,5)

1. It's the next clue I need to visit (Clue 4)
2. It's a valid move (vertically adjacent to my current position)
3. I haven't visited this cell yet

**Future Path Considerations:**
After reaching (3,5), I will have visited all 4 clues. I'll then need to fill the remaining 26 cells (36 total - 10 already filled). From (3,5), I'll need to plan a path that covers:
- All of rows 0 and 1 (12 cells)
- Row 2: positions (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5) (4 cells, since (2,3) and (2,4) are visited)
- Row 3: positions (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) (3 cells, since (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) are/will be visited)
- Row 4: positions (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) (3 cells, since (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are visited)
- Row 5: positions (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) (3 cells, since (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) are visited)

Total remaining: 25 cells + the current move to (3,5) = 26 cells to fill.

**Decision:**
The move to (3,5) is the correct and only logical choice. It visits the next required clue and maintains the path continuity.

MOVE: (3,5)

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:35:35,033 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
   - Current position: (3,3) - this is where clue 1 is located
   - Progress: 1/36 cells filled
   - Next target: Clue 2 at position (0,1)
   - Available moves: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - I need to reach clue 2 at (0,1) from my current position (3,3)
   - The distance from (3,3) to (0,1) is: |3-0| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps minimum
   - After visiting clue 2, I need to fill all remaining cells (36 total cells)
   - I must plan a path that doesn't trap me or leave unreachable cells

3. EVALUATION OF EACH MOVE:

   (2,3) - Moving UP:
   - Gets me closer to clue 2 (row 0)
   - Keeps me in column 3, which is 2 columns away from target column 1
   - This move maintains flexibility for path planning
   
   (4,3) - Moving DOWN:
   - Takes me AWAY from clue 2 (increases distance)
   - Would need to backtrack, wasting cells
   - Not efficient for reaching clue 2
   
   (3,2) - Moving LEFT:
   - Gets me closer to clue 2's column (column 1)
   - Maintains same row distance
   - Good lateral movement toward target
   
   (3,4) - Moving RIGHT:
   - Takes me AWAY from clue 2's column
   - Increases horizontal distance
   - Not optimal for reaching clue 2

4. DECISION:
   Between (2,3) and (3,2), both move closer to clue 2. However, I need to consider the overall path strategy:
   - Moving to (2,3) keeps me in a central column and moves upward
   - Moving to (3,2) moves me left toward the target column
   
   Given that I have a 6x6 grid and need to visit every cell, I should consider creating a systematic path. Moving up to (2,3) allows me to potentially snake through the board more efficiently. Starting upward movement early gives me more options to cover the board systematically before reaching clue 2.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,3)
- Path taken: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) - moving northward from clue 1
- Progress: 3/36 cells filled (33 cells remaining)
- Next target: Clue 2 at position (0,1)
- Available moves: (0,3), (1,2), (1,4)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to reach clue 2 at (0,1). From my current position (1,3), I need to navigate there efficiently while ensuring I can still visit all 36 cells in one continuous path.

3. EVALUATION:

Move to (0,3):
- Pros: Moves me north towards row 0 where clue 2 is located
- Cons: I'd be at (0,3), and clue 2 is at (0,1), requiring me to go west. This would put me in the top row, potentially limiting my path options and could create dead ends

Move to (1,2):
- Pros: Moves me west, getting closer to column 1 where clue 2 is located
- Cons: Stays in row 1, doesn't progress towards row 0 yet
- Path consideration: From (1,2), I could continue west to (1,1), then north to (0,1) to reach clue 2

Move to (1,4):
- Pros: Opens up the eastern side of the board
- Cons: Moves me AWAY from clue 2 (which is west and north). This seems counterproductive as I need to reach (0,1)

4. DECISION:
Move to (1,2) is the best choice because:
- It progresses towards clue 2's column (column 1)
- It keeps me flexible in row 1, allowing me to continue west to (1,1) and then north to (0,1)
- It doesn't trap me in the top row prematurely
- It maintains good connectivity for covering the entire board after reaching clue 2
- The logical path would be: (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) [clue 2]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:36:18,728 - INFO - THINKING:

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- Current position: (1,2)
- Path taken: Started at clue 1 at (3,3), moved up to (2,3), then to (1,3), then left to (1,2)
- Filled: 4/36 cells
- Next objective: Reach clue 2 at position (0,1)

**2. STRATEGY:**
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at (0,1). From my current position (1,2), I need to navigate there while being mindful of:
- Not trapping myself in a corner
- Ensuring I can still visit all 36 cells after reaching clue 2
- The path must be continuous and visit every cell exactly once

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

*Option A: (0,2)* - Move up
- Pros: Gets me closer to the top row where clue 2 is located
- Cons: Would be adjacent to clue 2 at (0,1), but I'd be one cell to the right. This could work.
- Future implications: From (0,2), I could go to (0,1) to hit clue 2, but I need to ensure I don't box myself in the top corner

*Option B: (2,2)* - Move down
- Pros: None - this takes me away from clue 2
- Cons: Moves me in the opposite direction from my target. Would require more moves to reach clue 2
- Future implications: Inefficient path, wastes moves

*Option C: (1,1)* - Move left
- Pros: Moves me directly toward clue 2 at (0,1). From (1,1), I can move up to (0,1) to reach clue 2
- Cons: None apparent - this is a direct path to the target
- Future implications: After reaching clue 2 from (1,1), I'll be at position (0,1) and can continue the path efficiently

**4. DECISION:**
Move (1,1) is optimal because:
1. It moves me directly toward clue 2
2. From (1,1), I can reach (0,1) in one move to collect clue 2
3. It doesn't waste any moves or cells
4. After collecting clue 2, I'll have plenty of room to snake through the remaining cells of the board

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (0,1) - this is where clue 2 is located
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (3,3), moved up and around to reach clue 2 at (0,1)
- Progress: 6/36 cells filled, meaning 30 cells remaining
- I've just reached clue 2, which was my target
- Available moves: (0,0) or (0,2)

2. STRATEGY:
- I've visited clues 1 and 2 in order (requirement met)
- Since there are only 2 clues and I've reached both, I now need to fill the remaining 30 cells
- My goal is to create a continuous path that visits all 36 cells exactly once
- I need to avoid creating isolated regions or trapping myself

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (0,0)
- This is a corner cell, which is generally risky as corners have only 2 possible connections
- Moving here early might be good since corners are hard to reach later
- From (0,0), I can only go to (1,0) next
- This would start a path along the left edge

Option B: Move to (0,2)
- This continues along the top row
- From (0,2), I could go to (0,3) or potentially (1,2), though (1,2) is already visited
- Actually, (1,2) is already in my path, so from (0,2) I can only go to (0,3)
- This would continue filling the top row from left to right

Let me think about the bigger picture:
- I have the top-left area partially filled: cells (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are used
- If I go to (0,0), I'll need to eventually work my way down the left column and then sweep across the board
- If I go to (0,2), I'll continue the top row, then need to work down

Given that I need to fill all 36 cells, going to (0,0) makes sense because:
1. Corners are hardest to reach and should be addressed when possible
2. Starting from the corner (0,0), I can trace down column 0, then work my way across the board systematically
3. This approach reduces the risk of creating unreachable cells

4. DECISION:
Move to (0,0) - the corner cell. This secures a difficult-to-reach position early and allows me to potentially trace a snake-like pattern down the left column and across the board.

Available Next Moves: (1,0)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:37:08,944 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0) and have filled 7 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:
   - I've already visited clues 1 (at 3,3) and 2 (at 0,1)
   - I'm now at (0,0) in the top-left corner
   - I have 29 more cells to fill
   - There are no more numbered clues to visit, so I need to create a path that fills all remaining cells

2. AVAILABLE MOVES:
   - From (0,0), I can only move to (1,0) since (0,1) is already visited

3. STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Since there are no more clues to visit, I need to design a path that efficiently covers all 29 remaining cells
   - I'm in a corner (0,0), which is typically challenging - corners limit movement options
   - I need to avoid creating isolated regions that would be impossible to visit later
   - A systematic approach like a snake/spiral pattern often works well for filling grids

4. PATH PLANNING:
   Looking at the board, I've already filled:
   - Column 3: cells (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)
   - Row 1: cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
   - Top-left area: (0,0), (0,1)
   
   The unfilled regions are:
   - Top right: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)
   - Most of rows 2-5
   
   From (0,0), moving to (1,0) allows me to continue down the left edge, which is a natural boundary. I can then sweep across the board systematically.

5. EVALUATION OF (1,0):
   PROS:
   - It's the only available move
   - Keeps me along the left edge, which is a good boundary to follow
   - Allows me to potentially snake through the remaining grid
   
   CONS:
   - None really, since it's the only option

The move to (1,0) is not just necessary but strategically sound as it keeps me along the board's edge, from where I can plan an efficient sweep pattern.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,0)
- Progress: 9/36 cells filled
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 (3,3), visited clue 2 (0,1), now at (2,0)
- All clues have been visited (clues 1 and 2)
- Need to fill remaining 27 cells to complete the 6x6 puzzle

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to fill all remaining empty cells
- I need to create a path that visits all 36 cells exactly once
- Must avoid creating dead ends or isolated regions
- Available moves: (3,0) going down, or (2,1) going right

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (3,0) - going down
- This moves me into the bottom-left corner region
- From (3,0), I would have access to (4,0) and potentially (3,1)
- Looking at the board, there are many empty cells in rows 3-5
- This keeps me on the left edge, allowing me to sweep through the lower portion

Option B: Move to (2,1) - going right
- This moves me into the middle-left area
- From (2,1), I could access (2,2) or (3,1)
- This would start filling the middle region
- However, I need to be careful not to create isolated pockets

Looking at the board layout:
- Bottom half (rows 3-5) has mostly empty cells
- Right side (columns 3-5) in rows 1-2 are empty
- I need to ensure I can reach all areas

If I go to (3,0), I can work my way down and across the bottom rows, then come back up through the right side. This seems like a more systematic approach.

If I go to (2,1), I might box myself in and create unreachable regions in the bottom-left corner.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (3,0) is better because:
- It allows me to systematically work through the bottom rows
- Prevents creating isolated regions in the lower-left
- Gives me a clear path strategy: go down to row 5, sweep right, then work back up through columns 1-5

2025-12-10 20:37:40,067 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 36 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,0)
- Progress: 10/36 cells filled
- I've already visited clue 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I've completed all required clue visits
- Now I need to fill the remaining 26 cells (36 total - 10 filled = 26 remaining)
- Available moves: (4,0) down or (3,1) right

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal is to create a path that visits all remaining 26 empty cells exactly once
- I need to be careful not to create isolated regions or dead ends that would prevent me from visiting all cells
- I'm currently in the left column (column 0), and I have cells below me and to the right

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (4,0) - Going DOWN
- This continues down the left edge
- From (4,0), I could continue to (5,0), filling the bottom-left corner
- This would put me at the corner, which could be good for sweeping through the board
- However, I need to ensure I don't trap myself

Option B: Move to (3,1) - Going RIGHT
- This moves into the interior of the board
- Looking at the board, column 1 has some empty cells: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)
- If I go right now, I might leave (4,0) and (5,0) isolated or create a dead end

Let me visualize what happens with each choice:

If I go to (4,0):
- From (4,0), I can go to (5,0) or (4,1)
- If I continue to (5,0), I'm at the bottom-left corner
- From (5,0), I can only go right to (5,1)
- This creates a natural sweeping pattern along the bottom

If I go to (3,1):
- I leave (4,0) and (5,0) behind in column 0
- To visit them later, I'd need to come back to column 0, which might be difficult
- This could create connectivity issues

4. DECISION:
Going to (4,0) is better because:
- It continues filling the leftmost column before moving inward
- It avoids leaving isolated cells in column 0
- It sets up a natural path along the bottom edge
- Following the left edge down ensures I don't trap those cells

I am currently at position (4,0) and have filled 11 out of 36 cells. Looking at my situation:

1. ANALYSIS: I've successfully visited clue 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1). Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue (there are only 2 clues), I've already visited all required clues. Now I need to fill the remaining 25 cells (36 total - 11 filled = 25 remaining) in a continuous path and end somewhere.

2. STRATEGY: Since I've visited all clues, my goal is to create a path that visits every remaining cell exactly once. I need to be careful not to create any isolated regions or trap myself in a dead end before visiting all cells.

3. EVALUATION of available moves:
   - Move to (5,0): This takes me to the bottom-left corner. From there, I would only have one exit (back to (4,0) which is already visited, or to (5,1)). This could work if I plan to sweep across the bottom row.
   - Move to (4,1): This keeps me in the middle area with more flexibility. From (4,1), I could move to (4,2), (5,1), or (3,1).

Looking at the board, I notice that the bottom row (row 5) is completely empty except for what I might fill now. The left column (column 0) is almost fully filled. 

If I go to (5,0), I'll be in the corner and must continue to (5,1), then likely sweep across row 5. This could be good as it fills the bottom systematically.

If I go to (4,1), I have more options but might leave (5,0) isolated for later, which could be problematic.

4. DECISION: I should move to (5,0) to fill the corner and then sweep across the bottom row. This prevents the corner from becoming isolated and gives me a clear path forward along row 5.

- The path must be continuous and visit every single cell exactly once

3. EVALUATION:
- Only option is (5,1)
- This move continues along the bottom row
- Looking at the board, I need to ensure I can reach all empty cells in the upper right area
- The board has many empty cells in rows 0-5, columns 2-5 that need to be filled

4. DECISION:
- I must move to (5,1) as it's the only available option

2025-12-10 20:38:20,283 - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,0)
- Progress: 12/36 cells filled
- I've already visited clues 1 at (3,3) and 2 at (0,1)
- All clues have been visited, so now I need to fill the remaining 24 empty cells
- Only one move available: (5,1)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've visited all numbered clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to create a path that visits all remaining 24 empty cells
- I need to be careful not to trap myself or create unreachable sections
- The path must be continuous and visit every single cell exactly once

3. EVALUATION:
- Only option is (5,1)
- This move continues along the bottom row
- Looking at the board, I need to ensure I can reach all empty cells in the upper right area
- The board has many empty cells in rows 0-5, columns 2-5 that need to be filled

4. DECISION:
- I must move to (5,1) as it's the only available option
- This allows me to continue building the path along the bottom and eventually work my way up to cover all remaining cells
- From (5,1), I'll have options to continue right along row 5 or move up to row 4

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,1)
- Progress: 13/36 cells filled
- I've already visited clue 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I should be working towards filling all remaining cells
- I have 23 cells left to fill
- Available moves: (4,1) and (5,2)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've visited both clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to fill all remaining 23 cells in a continuous path
- I need to ensure I don't trap myself or leave any cells unreachable
- Looking at the board, I need to cover the entire right side and middle areas that are still empty

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (4,1)
- This moves me upward (back towards row 4)
- Coordinates (4,1) is currently marked as "3" (empty cell to fill)
- This would allow me to explore the middle-right area of the board
- After this, I could continue to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) and work systematically

Option B: Move to (5,2)
- This moves me rightward along row 5
- Would continue along the bottom row
- From (5,2), I could go to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) covering the bottom
- However, this might make it harder to efficiently cover all the remaining cells in the upper-right quadrant

Let me think about the overall path strategy:
- Bottom row (5): I'm at (5,1), still need (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) - 4 cells
- Row 4: Need (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) - 5 cells  
- Row 3: Need (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5) - 4 cells
- Row 2: Need (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5) - 4 cells
- Row 1: Need (1,4), (1,5) - 2 cells
- Row 0: Need (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) - 4 cells

If I go to (5,2) and continue right, I'll need to come back up. If I go to (4,1), I can work upward and then snake through the remaining cells more efficiently.

4. DECISION:
I should move to (4,1). This allows me to start working upward and cover the middle section systematically. From (4,1), I can continue to explore rows 4, 3, 2, etc., and ensure I have a valid path that covers all remaining cells without getting trapped.

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (4,1)
   - Progress: 14/36 cells filled
   - I've already visited clue 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1)
   - Since I've visited both clues, I now need to complete the remaining 22 cells to fill all 36 cells
   - My path must end when all cells are visited (the puzzle only has 2 clues, so I end after filling all 36 cells)

2. STRATEGY:
   - I need to fill the remaining 22 empty cells without revisiting any cell
   - I must ensure I don't create dead ends or trap myself
   - Available moves: (3,1) or (4,2)

3. EVALUATION:
   
   Option A: Move to (3,1)
   - This moves me upward into row 3
   - Looking at the board, row 3 has cells at (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5) still empty
   - From (3,1), I could continue exploring the upper portion of the board
   - However, I need to check if this creates any isolated regions
   - The right side of the board (columns 3-5, rows 0-5) has many empty cells that need to be visited
   
   Option B: Move to (4,2)
   - This moves me right into column 2
   - From (4,2), I can continue right or up/down
   - Looking at the remaining empty cells, there's a large connected region on the right side
   - Column 2 has empty cells at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)
   
   Let me visualize the empty cells more carefully:
   - Row 0: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) - 4 cells
   - Row 1: (1,4), (1,5) - 2 cells
   - Row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5) - 4 cells
   - Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5) - 4 cells
   - Row 4: (4,2), (4,4), (4,5) - 3 cells (plus current at 4,1)
   - Row 5: (5,2), (5,3), (5,5) - 3 cells (plus (5,4) which shows as 5 but unclear)
   
   Wait, let me recount from the visual board. The cells marked with numbers in brackets are my path. I need to identify truly empty cells (marked with .)

4. DECISION:
   Moving to (4,2) seems better because:
   - It keeps me in the lower portion where I can systematically sweep right
   - From (4,2), I can move to (5,2) and continue filling the bottom rows
   - Then I can work my way up through the right side of the board
   - Moving to (3,1) might fragment the remaining path and make it harder to connect all regions
   
   The key is to avoid creating isolated pockets. Moving right to (4,2) allows me to stay connected to the large empty region on the right side of the board.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:39:16,067 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,2)
- Progress: 15/36 cells filled (21 cells remaining)
- I've already visited clues 1 at (3,3) and 2 at (0,1)
- All clues have been visited, so now I need to fill the remaining 21 cells in one continuous path
- Available moves: (3,2), (5,2), (4,3)

2. STRATEGY:
- Since I've visited all clues, my goal is to fill all remaining cells without getting trapped
- I need to ensure the path can reach all empty areas: the right side of the board (columns 3-5) and some cells in the middle
- Looking at the board, I have unfilled regions:
  - Upper right area (rows 0-2, columns 3-5)
  - Some cells in the middle-right (rows 3-5, columns 3-5)
  - Cell (5,2) and nearby areas

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: (3,2)
- Moves upward into the middle-left area
- This area is relatively isolated now since I've already filled most of the left side
- Could potentially trap me in the upper-middle section
- Might make it difficult to reach the right side efficiently

Option B: (5,2)
- Moves down to row 5
- Continues along the bottom row, which I've partially filled
- From (5,2), I could then move right to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) to fill the bottom row
- This creates a good foundation to then move up the right side
- Seems like a natural continuation of the path

Option C: (4,3)
- Moves right into the middle-right area
- This is a critical area I need to visit eventually
- From (4,3), I could access the right side of the board
- However, jumping directly here might make it harder to fill (5,2) later

4. DECISION:
The best move is (5,2). Here's why:
- It continues the logical flow of filling the bottom row first
- From (5,2), I can move to (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) to complete the bottom row
- After filling the bottom, I can work my way up the right side of the board systematically
- This approach minimizes the risk of creating isolated pockets that would trap me
- It maintains connectivity with all remaining unfilled areas

   - Available moves: (4,3) and (5,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since I've already visited all clues (1 and 2), I now need to fill the remaining empty cells
   - I must visit all 36 cells exactly once
   - Looking at the board, I need to cover the right side of the board which is mostly empty
   - The empty cells are in rows 0-4 on the right side (columns 3-5) and some in the middle

3. EVALUATION:
   
   Move to (4,3):
   - This goes upward to row 4, column 3
   - From the visual board, (4,3) is marked as "4" which appears to be empty
   - This would allow me to continue filling the middle/right portion
   - However, this might trap me or create dead ends in the bottom right corner
   
   Move to (5,4):
   - This goes right to row 5, column 4
   - This is marked as "5" on the board (empty cell)
   - This continues along the bottom row toward (5,5)
   - After reaching (5,5), I could move up column 5 and systematically fill the right side
   - This seems to provide a cleaner path that can snake through the remaining cells

4. DECISION:
   Looking at the empty cells, if I move to (5,4), I can:
   - Continue to (5,5) to complete the bottom row
   - Then move up column 5: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (0,5)
   - Then work my way back through the middle columns systematically
   
   If I move to (4,3) first, I risk creating a dead end in the bottom right corner (cells (5,4) and (5,5) could become isolated).
   
   The safer approach is to move to (5,4), complete the bottom row first, then work upward through the right side of the board.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:40:48,620 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,4)
- Cells filled: 19/36 (17 more cells to fill)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I don't need to visit any more clues
- I just need to fill the remaining 17 empty cells in a valid path

2. CURRENT STATE:
Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- Row 0: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)
- Row 1: (1,4), (1,5)
- Row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5)
- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5)
- Row 4: (4,3), (4,5)
- Row 5: (5,5)

3. AVAILABLE MOVES FROM (4,4):
- (3,4) - moves up
- (4,3) - moves left (already visited at step 4 according to visual, wait... let me recheck)
- (4,5) - moves right

Wait, looking at the visual board more carefully:
Row 4: [11] [14] [15] 4 [19] .
This means (4,3) shows "4" which seems to be empty (the legend shows clue numbers without brackets are empty cells with clue markers, but we don't have a clue 4). Actually, looking at the path, position (4,3) is NOT in the path taken list, so it's an empty cell.

Let me reconsider the available moves:
- (3,4): empty cell, moves up
- (4,3): empty cell, moves left  
- (4,5): empty cell, moves right

4. STRATEGY:
I need to create a path that visits all remaining 17 cells. Let me think about which direction gives me the best coverage:

- If I go to (4,5): I reach the right edge. From there I can go to (5,5) (corner), then I'd need to work my way back through the upper right section.
- If I go to (4,3): I move left but (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) are already visited, so I'd need to go up to row 3.
- If I go to (3,4): I move up into row 3 which has several empty cells.

5. EVALUATION:
Let me trace potential paths:

Option A - Move to (4,5):
(4,5) -> (5,5) -> then I need to cover (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3)
This could work - go to corner, then work back.

Option B - Move to (4,3):
(4,3) -> (3,3) is already visited, so must go to (4,3) then can't continue easily without going up.

Option C - Move to (3,4):
(3,4) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) -> (0,5) or continue building path
This allows me to sweep the right side first.

Given that (4,5) and (5,5) form a corner that's currently unvisited, and I need to visit (5,5) at some point, moving to (4,5) first makes sense to avoid getting trapped.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:41:14,827 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **ANALYSIS**: 
   - Current position: (4,5)
   - Cells filled: 20/36
   - All clues have been visited (1 at (3,3) and 2 at (0,1))
   - Since I've visited all clues, my goal now is to fill all remaining 16 cells in a valid path
   - Available moves: (3,5) or (5,5)

2. **STRATEGY**:
   - No more clues to visit - I just need to complete the remaining path through all empty cells
   - I need to ensure my path can reach all unfilled cells without getting trapped
   - Remaining empty cells to fill: 16 cells (36 total - 20 filled)
   - Empty cells are at: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,5)

3. **EVALUATION**:
   
   **Option A: Move to (3,5)**
   - This moves upward to row 3
   - From (3,5), I could access the upper-right area: (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2)
   - Then work my way down through middle areas
   - This seems like it could help me sweep through the right side systematically
   
   **Option B: Move to (5,5)**
   - This moves to the bottom-right corner
   - Corner positions are typically dangerous as they limit options
   - From (5,5), I can only go to (4,5) [already visited] or back through (3,5)
   - This would force me back to (3,5) anyway, wasting a cell
   - However, I need to visit (5,5) eventually since it's empty
   
   Let me think more carefully: If I go to (5,5) now, I'm in a corner with only one exit back to (4,5) which is already visited. This means (5,5) can ONLY be the last cell of my path, OR I must enter it from a different direction later.
   
   Looking at the board, (5,5) can be accessed from (5,4) [already visited at step 18] or (4,5) [current position]. Since (5,4) is already used, if I don't go to (5,5) now, I'll never be able to reach it later!

4. **DECISION**:
   - I MUST go to (5,5) now because it's a corner cell that can only be reached from (4,5) [my current position] or (5,4) [already visited]
   - If I go to (3,5) now, (5,5) becomes unreachable, making the puzzle unsolvable
   - After (5,5), I'll be forced to end or the path must have been designed to end there... wait, let me reconsider.
   
   Actually, if (5,5) is a dead end and I go there, I can't continue. Let me check: from (5,5), the only adjacent cell is (5,4) [visited] and (4,5) [visited]. This means (5,5) MUST be the final cell of the path!
   
   But I still have 15 more cells to fill after this move! So going to (5,5) now would trap me.
   
   Therefore, I must go to (3,5) and find a way to reach (5,5) as the very last cell through a different route... but that's impossible since both neighbors of (5,5) are already visited.
   
   This means the puzzle path must NOT include (5,5) as I initially thought, OR there's an error. Let me recount: The board is 6x6 = 36 cells. I've filled 20. That leaves 16 empty cells. But wait—checking the visual board and path, this seems correct.

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,5)
- Filled: 21/36 cells (15 cells remaining)
- I've already visited both clues: Clue 1 at (3,3) and Clue 2 at (0,1)
- Available moves: (2,5) or (3,4)

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to fill all remaining 15 empty cells without getting trapped. Let me identify the empty cells:
- Row 0: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)
- Row 1: (1,4), (1,5)
- Row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5)
- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,3)
- Row 5: (5,5)

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (2,5)
- This moves me upward to row 2
- From (2,5), I could access (1,5) and (2,4)
- This would allow me to sweep through the upper right area
- Path could be: (2,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) -> (0,5) -> ... then work back down
- This seems promising as it captures the top-right corner cells

Option B: Move to (3,4)
- This moves me left along row 3
- From (3,4), I could access (2,4) or (3,3) [but (3,3) is already visited]
- This would leave (2,5) potentially isolated at the end
- If I go to (3,4), then to reach (2,5) later, I'd need to go through (2,4), but this might create path complications

4. DECISION:
Moving to (2,5) is the better choice because:
- It allows me to systematically fill the top-right corner (rows 0-2, columns 4-5)
- From (2,5), I can reach (1,5), then (1,4), then (0,4), (0,5), and work my way back
- After clearing the top-right, I can return to fill the middle section
- Moving to (3,4) first would risk leaving (2,5) isolated or harder to reach efficiently

(2,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) -> (0,5) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> work back through middle cells

- It allows me to systematically fill the top-right corner (rows 0-2, columns 4-5)
- From (2,5), I can reach (1,5), then (1,4), then (0,4), (0,5), and work my way back
- After clearing the top-right, I can return to fill the middle section
- Moving to (3,4) first would risk leaving (2,5) isolated or harder to reach efficiently

The path strategy from (2,5):
(2,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (0,4) -> (0,5) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> work back through middle cells

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,5)
- Progress: 22/36 cells filled, so 14 cells remain
- I've already visited clue 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining empty cells
- Available moves: (1,5) or (2,4)

Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- Row 0: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)
- Row 1: (1,4), (1,5)
- Row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)
- Row 5: (5,5)

2. STRATEGY:
Since all clues are visited, I need to create a path that visits all remaining 14 empty cells without getting trapped. I must ensure the path can reach all areas and end at (5,5) or another accessible endpoint.

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,5)
- This moves up to row 1
- From (1,5), I can access (0,5) and (1,4)
- This would allow me to fill the top-right corner: (1,5) -> (0,5) -> (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2)
- Then I could come back down via (1,4) -> (2,4) and continue to fill the middle section
- This seems like a good approach to systematically clear the top rows

Option B: Move to (2,4)
- This keeps me in row 2
- From (2,4), I could go to (1,4) or (3,4)
- If I go to (2,4) first, I might have difficulty reaching the upper-right corner efficiently
- The path would be less systematic

4. DECISION:
Moving to (1,5) is better because:
- It allows me to systematically clear the top-right corner
- From (1,5), I can snake through: (1,5) -> (0,5) -> (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> back to row 1 -> (1,4) -> (2,4)
- Then continue to fill the middle empty cells at row 2 and 3
- Finally reach (5,5) at the end
- This creates a continuous path without risk of getting trapped

I am currently at position (1,5) and have filled 23 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:

   - All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining 13 empty cells
   - I'm at (1,5) in the top-right area

3. EVALUATION OF MOVES:
   
   Option A: Move to (0,5)
   - This moves up to the top-right corner
   - From (0,5), I could continue left along row 0: (0,4), (0,3), (0,2)

   Option B: Move to (1,4)
   - This moves left on row 1
   - From (1,4), I would then need to go up to (0,4) to fill the top row
   - But this might create connectivity issues - after going to (0,4), I'd need to fill (0,5) but I can't since I came from (1,5) which is already visited
   - This would trap (0,5) as unreachable!

4. CRITICAL ANALYSIS:
   If I go to (1,4), then (0,5) becomes isolated and unreachable because:
   - (0,5) can only be reached from (0,4) or (1,5)
   - (1,5) is already visited (my current position)
   - If I'm at (1,4), I can go to (0,4), but then (0,5) would still need to be reached from (0,4), meaning I'd have to visit (0,4) twice, which violates the rules

   Therefore, I MUST go to (0,5) first to avoid trapping it.

5. PATH PLANNING:
   Moving to (0,5), then I can sweep left along row 0: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2)
   Then drop down and work through the middle section to complete all remaining cells.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 20:42:36,811 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,5)
- Cells filled: 24/36, so I need to fill 12 more cells
- I've already visited clues 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1)
- Since clue 2 is the highest clue and I've already visited it, I just need to complete the path visiting all remaining empty cells
- Available move: (0,4) - this is my only option from (0,5)

2. REMAINING EMPTY CELLS:
Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- Row 0: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)
- Row 1: (1,4)
- Row 2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,3)
- Row 5: (5,5)

That's 12 empty cells, which matches 36 - 24 = 12 cells remaining.

3. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all clues (1 and 2), I need to visit all remaining empty cells in one continuous path without revisiting any cell. The path must end at one of these empty cells.

4. EVALUATION OF (0,4):
- From (0,5), I can only move to (0,4) (the only adjacent unvisited cell)
- This is the only available move, so I must take it
- From (0,4), I'll need to plan carefully to reach all remaining cells

5. LOOKING AHEAD:
After moving to (0,4), I'll need to continue filling the remaining 11 cells. From (0,4), I can move to:
- (0,3) - continuing left along row 0
- (1,4) - moving down

I need to ensure I can visit all empty cells. Let me trace a potential path:
(0,5) -> (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> then I'd need to go down and work through the middle sections to eventually reach (5,5).

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (0,4)
- Progress: 25/36 cells filled, so 11 cells remaining
- I've already visited both clues (1 at position (3,3) and 2 at position (0,1))
- Since I've visited all clues, I just need to fill the remaining empty cells
- Available moves: (1,4) or (0,3)

Let me identify the empty cells:
- (0,2), (0,3) - Row 0
- (1,4) - Row 1
- (2,1), (2,2), (2,4) - Row 2
- (3,1), (3,2), (3,4) - Row 3
- (4,3) - Row 4
- (5,5) - Row 5

Total: 11 empty cells (matches remaining count)

2. STRATEGY:
Since all clues are visited, I need to create a path that visits all remaining empty cells without getting trapped. This requires careful planning to avoid dead ends.

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,4)
- This would continue down from (0,4) to (1,4)
- From (1,4), I could potentially move to (2,4)
- This creates a path along column 4
- Then I'd need to work my way through the remaining cells in rows 2 and 3

Option B: Move to (0,3)
- This would move left from (0,4) to (0,3)
- From (0,3), I could move to (0,2), continuing left
- This would complete row 0 first
- Then I'd need to come back down to fill the middle section

Let me trace potential paths:

If I go to (1,4):
(0,4) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,2) [can't go to (2,3), it's filled] 
Wait, from (2,4) I can go to (3,4) or (2,3). But (2,3) is filled (position 2 of path).
From (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,2) [can't go direct, need to check]
Actually from (3,4), I can go to (3,3) [filled], (4,4) [filled], (2,4) [came from], or (3,5) [filled]
This seems problematic.

If I go to (0,3):
(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) [filled] 
From (0,2), I can only go to (0,3) [came from] or (0,1) [filled] or (1,2) [filled]
This creates a dead end!

Wait, let me reconsider. From (0,3), I don't have to go to (0,2) immediately.
From (0,3), I could go to (0,2) or (1,3) [filled]. So only (0,2) is available from (0,3).

Actually, going to (0,3) leads to (0,2) which is a dead end.

Let me reconsider (1,4):
From (1,4), available moves: (1,3) [filled], (1,5) [filled], (0,4) [came from], (2,4)
So from (1,4) -> (2,4)
From (2,4): (2,3) [filled], (2,5) [filled], (1,4) [came from], (3,4)
So from (2,4) -> (3,4)
From (3,4): (3,3) [filled], (3,5) [filled], (2,4) [came from], (4,4) [filled]
Dead end!

Both options seem problematic. Let me reconsider the empty cells and find a valid path.

Actually, I need to think about this more carefully. The path must visit ALL remaining cells. Let me see if there's a Hamiltonian path through the remaining cells.

After careful consideration, (1,4)

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:43:57,004 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 20:43:57,018 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,4)
- Progress: 27/36 cells filled, so 9 cells remaining
- I've already visited clue 1 at (3,3) and clue 2 at (0,1)
- All clues have been visited, so now I just need to fill the remaining 9 empty cells
- Available move: (3,4)

Looking at the visual board, the empty cells are:
- (0,2), (0,3)
- (1,2) - Wait, this shows [4] which means it's filled
- (2,1), (2,2)
- (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)
- (4,3)
- (5,5)

Let me recount: Looking at the path, cells filled are at positions shown with brackets. Empty cells marked with "." are:
- (0,2), (0,3)
- (2,1), (2,2)
- (3,1), (3,2), (3,4)
- (4,3)
- (5,5)

That's 9 empty cells, which matches 36 - 27 = 9.

2. STRATEGY:
Since all clues are visited, I need to create a path that fills all remaining empty cells without trapping myself. The path must be continuous and visit each cell exactly once.

3. EVALUATION:
From (2,4), the only available move is (3,4).

Let me trace what happens if I go to (3,4):
- From (3,4), I could potentially go to (3,3) [already visited], (3,5) [already visited], (2,4) [just came from], or (4,4) [already visited]
- Wait, this seems problematic. Let me reconsider.

Actually, from (3,4) I need to check adjacent cells:
- (2,4): Already visited (current position before this move)
- (3,3): Already visited
- (3,5): Already visited
- (4,4): Already visited

Hmm, but (3,4) is marked as empty, so I must go there. After reaching (3,4), I need to find a path to fill the remaining 8 cells.

Looking more carefully at empty cells and their connectivity:
After (3,4), I would need to backtrack through already visited cells, which violates the rules. 

Wait - let me reconsider the board. The move (3,4) connects to the empty region. From (3,4), I actually need to check what's truly available. Since (3,4) is empty and adjacent cells in the path are visited, I need to reconsider if there's a path forward.

Looking at the remaining empty cells: (0,2), (0,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3), (5,5)

The only move available from (2,4) is (3,4), so I must take it.

4. DECISION:
I must move to (3,4) as it's the only available option. From there, I'll need to carefully navigate to fill all remaining cells.

2025-12-10 20:44:31,253 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (3,4)
- Cells filled: 28/36
- Cells remaining: 8

**Remaining Empty Cells:**
Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- (0,2), (0,3)
- (2,1), (2,2)
- (3,1), (3,2)
- (4,3)
- (5,5)

**Available Moves from (3,4):**
From position (3,4), I can move to:
1. (3,3) - Already visited (this was clue 1, step 1)
2. (3,5) - Already visited (step 21)
3. (2,4) - Already visited (step 27)
4. (4,4) - Already visited (step 19)

All adjacent cells have been visited! The puzzle indicates "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)"

**Problem Analysis:**
I need to trace back and understand why I'm stuck. Looking at the path:
- I've visited 28 cells
- There are 8 empty cells remaining: (0,2), (0,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,5)
- My current position (3,4) has no unvisited adjacent cells

**Checking Connectivity:**
The remaining empty cells form disconnected regions:
1. Top row: (0,2), (0,3)
2. Middle left: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)
3. Bottom middle: (4,3)
4. Bottom right corner: (5,5)

Since I'm at (3,4) and all adjacent cells are visited, I cannot continue the path. This indicates the puzzle has been incorrectly solved up to this point, or there's an error in the path taken.

**Wait - Let me reconsider:**
Actually, looking more carefully at position (3,4), let me check what's actually adjacent and unvisited. But according to the visual board, position (3,4) shows [28], and looking at adjacent cells:
- (3,3) = [1] (visited)
- (3,5) = [21] (visited)
- (2,4) = [27] (visited)
- (4,4) = [19] (visited)

This confirms I am indeed stuck with no valid moves available.

**Conclusion:**
The puzzle appears to be in an unsolvable state from the current position. The path taken has created a situation where the remaining 8 cells cannot be reached without revisiting already-visited cells, which violates the rules.

MOVE: Unable to move - puzzle is in an unsolvable state from current position. The path needs to be reconsidered from an earlier point to ensure all 36 cells can be visited in one continuous path.

2025-12-10 20:44:31,386 - INFO - Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (3,4)
- Cells filled: 28/36
- Cells remaining: 8

**Remaining Empty Cells:**
Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
- (0,2), (0,3)
- (2,1), (2,2)
- (3,1), (3,2)
- (4,3)
- (5,5)

**Available Moves from (3,4):**
From position (3,4), I can move to:
1. (3,3) - Already visited (this was clue 1, step 1)
2. (3,5) - Already visited (step 21)
3. (2,4) - Already visited (step 27)
4. (4,4) - Already visited (step 19)

All adjacent cells have been visited! The puzzle indicates "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)"

**Problem Analysis:**
I need to trace back and understand why I'm stuck. Looking at the path:
- I've visited 28 cells
- There are 8 empty cells remaining: (0,2), (0,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,5)
- My current position (3,4) has no unvisited adjacent cells

**Checking Connectivity:**
The remaining empty cells form disconnected regions:
1. Top row: (0,2), (0,3)
2. Middle left: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)
3. Bottom middle: (4,3)
4. Bottom right corner: (5,5)

Since I'm at (3,4) and all adjacent cells are visited, I cannot continue the path. This indicates the puzzle has been incorrectly solved up to this point, or there's an error in the path taken.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - I'm currently at position (2,3) where clue 1 is located
   - I've filled 1/36 cells
   - I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (3,0)
   - Available moves: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - My next target is clue 2 at position (3,0)
   - From (2,3), I need to move left and down to reach (3,0)
   - The direct path would be: left 3 steps, down 1 step (total 4 steps)

3. EVALUATION of available moves:
   
   a) (1,3) - Moving UP:
      - Takes me away from clue 2 (which is down and left)
      - Would need to backtrack later
      - Not optimal
   
   b) (3,3) - Moving DOWN:
      - Gets me closer to clue 2's row (row 3)
      - Still need to go left 3 steps to reach (3,0)
      - Keeps me on the same row as clue 2
      - Good option
   
   c) (2,2) - Moving LEFT:
      - Gets me closer to clue 2's column
      - Moving in the right horizontal direction
      - Still need to go down 1 step and left 2 more steps
      - Good option
   
   d) (2,4) - Moving RIGHT:
      - Takes me away from clue 2 (which is to the left)
      - Would require significant backtracking
      - Not optimal

4. DECISION:
   Between (3,3) and (2,2), I need to consider the path layout. Since I need to fill all 36 cells, I should think about creating an efficient path.
   
   Moving to (2,2) allows me to continue left along row 2, then potentially snake down to row 3 to reach clue 2. This creates a more natural flow.
   
   Moving to (3,3) puts me on row 3 immediately, but I'd still need to traverse left, and it might create awkward path constraints later.
   
   I'll choose (2,2) as it allows for a smoother path construction and keeps my options open for filling the board efficiently.

2025-12-10 20:45:18,089 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,2)
- Path taken: Started at clue 1 at (2,3), moved to (2,2)
- Cells filled: 2/36
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (3,0)
- Available moves: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to reach clue 2 at position (3,0). From (2,2), I need to navigate there while ensuring I can still visit all 36 cells in one continuous path. The most direct path would be to go left and down.

3. EVALUATION:
Let me evaluate each available move:

- **(1,2) - Moving UP**: This takes me away from clue 2 (which is down and to the left). This could be useful for creating a longer path, but I need to be careful not to trap myself. Moving up gives me access to the top portion of the board.

- **(3,2) - Moving DOWN**: This moves me closer to the row of clue 2 (row 3), but I'm still in column 2, and clue 2 is in column 0. This seems like a reasonable intermediate step.

- **(2,1) - Moving LEFT**: This moves me directly toward clue 2, getting me one column closer. From (2,1), I would be at row 2, column 1, and clue 2 is at row 3, column 0.

4. DECISION:
Since I have 36 cells to fill and only 2 clues, I need to create a path that efficiently uses all cells. The key consideration is:

- If I go to (2,1), I can then go to (2,0), then down to (3,0) to reach clue 2. This is a direct path.
- However, I need to think about whether this allows me to fill all remaining cells after visiting clue 2.

Let me think about the overall path strategy: After reaching clue 2 at (3,0), I'll need to cover the remaining 34 cells. A snake-like pattern would work well.

Moving to (2,1) keeps me on a direct path to clue 2 while allowing flexibility. From (2,1), I can go to (2,0), then (3,0) for clue 2, and then snake through the rest of the board.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 20:45:35,422 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - I'm currently at position (2,1)
   - I've filled 3/36 cells so far
   - My path: (2,3) [clue 1] -> (2,2) -> (2,1)
   - Next target: Clue 2 at position (3,0)
   - Available moves: (1,1), (3,1), (2,0)

2. STRATEGY:
   - I need to reach clue 2 at position (3,0) next
   - From (2,1), I need to navigate to (3,0)
   - This requires moving down and left

3. EVALUATION of each move:
   
   a) Move to (1,1): 
      - CONS: Takes me UP and away from clue 2 at (3,0), which is below me
      - This would be moving in the wrong direction
      - Would require backtracking later
   
   b) Move to (3,1):
      - PROS: Moves me DOWN one row, getting closer to clue 2
      - From (3,1), I can then move left to (3,0) to reach clue 2
      - This is a direct path toward my target
      - CONS: None apparent - this is the logical progression
   
   c) Move to (2,0):
      - PROS: Moves me left, getting closer horizontally to clue 2
      - CONS: I'm at row 2, but clue 2 is at row 3, so I'd still need to go down
      - From (2,0), I'd have to go to (3,0), but that's only one more step
      - This also works as a valid path

4. DECISION:
   Comparing options (3,1) and (2,0):
   - Option (3,1): Go down first, then left: (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) = 2 moves to clue 2
   - Option (2,0): Go left first, then down: (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) = 2 moves to clue 2
   
   Both reach clue 2 in the same number of steps. However, I need to consider the entire puzzle. Looking at the board, I notice clue numbers on the visual board that suggest other clues exist (I see numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 on the board edges). 
   
   Going to (2,0) first allows me to stay on row 2 longer and potentially access the upper portion of the board more effectively. Then I can drop down to (3,0) for clue 2.

   Actually, let me reconsider: the path (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) is direct and efficient for reaching clue 2.

2025-12-10 20:46:00,759 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (3,0), which is clue 2. I have filled 5 out of 36 cells. My path so far has been: (2,3) [clue 1] -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) [clue 2]. I have successfully visited clues 1 and 2 in order.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've reached clue 2, I now need to continue my path to eventually reach the remaining clues. Looking at the board, I can see:
- Clue 3 is at position (4,0)
- Clue 2 is at position (5,3)
- Clue 5 is at position (0,1)
- Clue 6 is at position (5,5)

Wait, let me recheck the visual board. I see "3" at (4,0), "2" at (5,3), "5" at (0,1), and "6" at (5,5). So the next clue I need to visit is clue 3 at position (4,0).

3. EVALUATION:
My available moves are:
- (4,0): This is exactly where clue 3 is located! This would allow me to continue visiting clues in order.
- (3,1): This moves right, away from clue 3. While it keeps options open, it doesn't directly progress toward the next required clue.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (4,0) is clearly the best choice because:
- It takes me directly to clue 3, maintaining the required ascending order
- It's the most efficient path
- Since clue 3 is immediately adjacent, there's no reason to delay visiting it
- After visiting clue 3, I'll still have access to continue the path (can move to (4,1) or (5,0))

2025-12-10 20:46:17,102 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,0) and have filled 6 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (4,0)
   - Path so far: Started at clue 1 (2,3), moved left to (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), then down to clue 2 at (3,0), and now at (4,0)
   - I've visited both clues (1 and 2), so now I need to fill the remaining 30 cells
   - Since clue 2 at (3,0) is the highest numbered clue, I must end my path there... Wait, I'm already past clue 2!
   
   Let me reconsider: Looking at the board, there's a "2" shown at position (5,3) and a "6" at (5,5). So there are more clues than just 1 and 2!

2. STRATEGY:
   - I need to eventually reach higher numbered clues. I see clue 2 at (5,3) (not yet visited based on the visual)
   - Wait, I'm confused. Let me re-read: Clue 2 is at position (3,0) which I've already visited at step 5 of my path
   - But the visual shows "2" at (5,3) and "6" at (5,5)
   - These must be additional clues! So I need to visit them in order
   - Next clue after 2 would be at (5,3), and the final clue 6 is at (5,5)

3. EVALUATION:
   - Available moves: (5,0) or (4,1)
   
   Option A: Move to (5,0)
   - Pros: Moves me down toward the bottom row where clues 2 and 6 are located
   - Cons: Might box me into the bottom-left corner
   
   Option B: Move to (4,1)
   - Pros: Moves me right, giving more flexibility to snake around the board
   - Cons: Moves away from the next clue temporarily
   
   Since I have 30 more cells to fill and need to eventually reach (5,3) and end at (5,5), I should consider which path allows me to fill all cells. Moving to (5,0) keeps me on the left edge, which might be better for snaking through the entire board systematically.

4. DECISION:
   Moving to (5,0) allows me to work along the bottom row and eventually reach the remaining clues. This creates a natural path progression.

2025-12-10 20:46:31,574 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (5,0) and have filled 7 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (5,0) - bottom-left corner
   - Path so far: Started at clue 1 (2,3), went left to (2,0), then down through (3,0) which is clue 2, and continued to (4,0) and (5,0)
   - I've already visited both clues (1 and 2) as required
   - I need to fill the remaining 29 cells in one continuous path
   - I'm in a corner position with only one available move: (5,1)

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to create a path that visits all remaining 29 empty cells
   - I need to be careful not to create isolated sections that I can't reach later
   - From a corner position, I have limited options - I must move to (5,1)

3. EVALUATION:
   - Move to (5,1): This is my only option. It keeps me along the bottom row, allowing me to potentially sweep across the bottom and then work my way up through the grid systematically.
   
   Pros: 
   - Only available move
   - Keeps me on the bottom row, which is a good starting point for a systematic sweep
   - Doesn't immediately create any isolated cells
   
   Cons:
   - None really, as it's the only move available

4. DECISION:
   Since (5,1) is the only available move, I must take it. The key consideration for future moves will be to create a snake-like pattern that efficiently covers all cells without trapping myself. A common strategy would be to sweep along rows or create an S-pattern through the grid.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. **CURRENT POSITION**: I'm at (5,2) with 9/36 cells filled
2. **PATH SO FAR**: Started at clue 1 (2,3), went through clue 2 (3,0), and now I'm in the bottom-left area
3. **REMAINING CELLS**: 27 cells left to fill
4. **CLUES VISITED**: Clue 1 and Clue 2 (all clues visited)
5. **GOAL**: Fill all remaining 27 cells in one continuous path ending somewhere

**AVAILABLE MOVES**: (4,2) and (5,3)

Let me evaluate each option:

**Option 1: Move to (4,2)**
- This moves me UP from (5,2) to (4,2)
- Pros: Allows me to explore the middle area of the board
- Cons: Could potentially trap me or create isolated regions

**Option 2: Move to (5,3)**
- This moves me RIGHT from (5,2) to (5,3)
- Pros: Continues along the bottom row, which I haven't fully explored yet
- Cons: I need to eventually cover the entire board, so I need to be strategic

**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION**: 
Looking at the board, I notice:
- The entire top half (rows 0-1) is unexplored
- The right side of the board (columns 4-5) is mostly unexplored
- I'm currently in the bottom-left corner area

Since I need to fill ALL 36 cells, I should think about creating a path that efficiently covers the board without trapping myself. A common strategy is to use a snake-like pattern or ensure I don't create isolated pockets.

If I go to (5,3), I continue along the bottom row. This allows me to potentially sweep right, then move up the right side, and snake back through the upper portions of the board.

If I go to (4,2), I move upward but this might create complications with the bottom-right area becoming harder to reach without revisiting cells.

**DECISION**: Moving to (5,3) keeps my options open and allows me to continue sweeping the bottom row before moving upward systematically.

2025-12-10 20:47:29,025 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (5,3) and have filled 10 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

**Current Status:**
- I've already visited clue 1 at (2,3) and clue 2 at (3,0)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I need to eventually end at (3,0), but I've already passed through it
- Wait, looking at the path again: I started at (2,3) [clue 1], then went to (3,0) [clue 2] at step 5
- But the rules state I must END at the highest numbered clue, which is clue 2 at (3,0)
- This means I've made an error - I shouldn't have left clue 2 since it's the final destination

Actually, let me reconsider. Looking at the board:
- There's a "6" shown at position (5,5) on the visual board
- This indicates there might be more clues than just 1 and 2
- Let me check: the visual shows "5" at (0,1) and "6" at (5,5)

Wait, I need to reread the clue locations. The puzzle states:
- Clue 1: position (2,3)
- Clue 2: position (3,0)

But the visual board shows additional numbers (5 at top, 6 at bottom right). These must be additional clues not listed in the clue section, or they represent something else.

Given the information provided states only clues 1 and 2 exist, and I need to end at clue 2 (the highest), but I've already passed through (3,0), this seems problematic.

However, looking at the actual task at hand: I need to fill all 36 cells in one continuous path. I've filled 10 cells so far. My available moves are (4,3) and (5,4).

**Analyzing the moves:**

1. **(4,3)**: This moves me up from (5,3) to (4,3)
   - This would allow me to explore the middle-right portion of the board
   - I still have 26 cells to fill
   - Moving up gives me access to unexplored territory

2. **(5,4)**: This moves me right from (5,3) to (5,4)
   - This continues along the bottom row
   - Would move me toward (5,5)
   - Keeps me on the bottom edge

**Strategy Consideration:**
Since I need to fill all 36 cells, I should avoid boxing myself in. Looking at the current path, I've filled the entire left column from (2,0) to (5,0) and the bottom row from (5,0) to (5,3). 

If I go to (5,4) then (5,5), I'll have completed the bottom row and bottom-left corner. This would leave me at (5,5) in the corner with only one exit (back to 5,4), which is already used. This would be a dead end!

If I go to (4,3), I move upward into unexplored territory, giving me more flexibility to navigate and fill the remaining cells without trapping myself.

**Decision:**
Move to (4,3) to avoid cornering myself and maintain access to the unexplored portions of the board.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:47:54,413 - INFO - THINKING:

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- Current position: (4,3)
- Progress: 11/36 cells filled
- I've already visited clue 1 at (2,3) and clue 2 at (3,0)
- Since clue 2 is the highest clue, I need to eventually return to it or I'm already past it
- Wait, let me reconsider: I started at clue 1 (2,3), visited clue 2 (3,0), and now I need to check if there are more clues
- Looking at the clue list: Only clues 1 and 2 are given, and there's a "6" shown at position (5,5)
- Actually, reviewing the visual board: there's a "6" at (5,5) which appears to be a clue I haven't visited yet!

Let me recount the clues from the visual board:
- Clue 1 at (2,3) - visited as step [1]
- Clue 2 at (3,0) - visited as step [5]
- There appears to be a clue 6 at (5,5) that I need to visit

But wait, the rules say visit clues in ascending order 1->2->3... If there's a clue 6, there should be clues 3, 4, and 5. Let me re-examine the board.

Actually, looking more carefully at the legend: The "6" at (5,5) is just showing it's an unvisited clue cell, not that I'm looking for clue 6.

Re-reading the clue locations: Only clue 1 at (2,3) and clue 2 at (3,0) are listed. So clue 2 is the highest clue, and I should end there. But I've already visited it at step 5!

This means I need to fill all remaining 25 cells (36 total - 11 filled = 25 remaining) and create a path that uses all cells.

**2. STRATEGY:**
Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to fill all 36 cells with a continuous path. I need to plan a route that doesn't trap myself and covers all remaining cells.

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

Available moves from (4,3): (3,3), (4,2), (4,4)

- **(3,3)**: Moves up. This would start filling the middle-right area. Could potentially create a path through the upper right section.

- **(4,2)**: Moves left. This continues along row 4, but I've already been to (4,0), so I'd be filling the gap. This might limit my options later.

- **(4,4)**: Moves right. Opens up the right side of the board. The entire right portion (columns 4-5) of rows 0-4 is unexplored, plus I haven't touched most of rows 0-1.

**4. DECISION:**

Looking at the unexplored territory:
- Rows 0-1: Completely unexplored except (0,1)
- Right side (columns 4-5) of rows 0-4: Mostly unexplored
- Some cells in the middle need filling

Moving to (4,4) gives me access to column 4 and 5 on the right side. From there, I can sweep up through column 5, then work my way back through the upper rows. This creates a natural flow pattern.

If I go to (3,3) or (4,2) first, I might box myself in and have difficulty reaching all the cells in the upper right corner.

The best strategy is to move right to (4,4), then continue up the right side, sweep through the top rows, and work back down.

2025-12-10 20:49:04,725 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,5) and have filled 14 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
   - Current position: (3,5)
   - Cells filled: 14/36
   - Remaining cells to fill: 22
   - All clues have been visited (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
   - Available moves: (2,5) and (3,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since I've already visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to complete the path by visiting all remaining 22 cells
   - I need to ensure I don't trap myself in a dead end
   - The path must be continuous and visit every cell exactly once

3. EVALUATION:
   
   Looking at the current board state:
   - Row 0: Cells (0,0), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) are empty (5 cells)
   - Row 1: All 6 cells are empty
   - Row 2: Cells (2,4), (2,5) are empty (2 cells)
   - Row 3: Cells (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are empty (4 cells)
   - Row 4: Cells (4,1), (4,2) are empty (2 cells)
   - Row 5: Cell (5,5) is empty (1 cell)
   
   Total empty cells: 5 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 20 cells (plus my current position makes 21, but I need 22 more moves)
   
   Wait, let me recount: I'm at step 14, need to reach 36, so 22 more cells to fill.
   
   Option A: Move to (2,5)
   - This moves me up to row 2
   - From (2,5), I could continue to (2,4), then work my way through the upper portion
   - This seems natural as it allows me to fill the remaining cells in row 2, then move to rows 1 and 0
   
   Option B: Move to (3,4)
   - This moves me left along row 3
   - From (3,4), I would need to navigate through (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)
   - This might create complications since I'd be moving away from the large empty areas in rows 0-1

4. DECISION:
   Moving to (2,5) is the better choice because:
   - It positions me to efficiently sweep through the remaining empty cells in the upper rows
   - From (2,5), I can move to (2,4), then systematically cover rows 1 and 0
   - It avoids potential trapping situations in the middle of the board
   - The upper right corner is less constrained and offers more flexibility for completing the path

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:49:23,009 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,5) and have filled 15 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (2,5)
   - Cells filled: 15/36 (21 cells remaining)
   - I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
   - Available moves: (1,5) or (2,4)

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since I've visited all clues, my goal is to fill all remaining 21 cells without getting trapped
   - I need to ensure I can reach all empty cells in the top portion of the board
   - Looking at the board, there are many empty cells in rows 0, 1, and some in rows 2-3

3. EVALUATION:
   
   Option A: Move to (1,5)
   - This moves me upward into row 1
   - From (1,5), I can access the entire top-right area
   - This opens up the upper portion of the board which has many empty cells
   - I could potentially work my way through row 1, then row 0, and come back down
   
   Option B: Move to (2,4)
   - This moves me left along row 2
   - From (2,4), I'd be at position (2,4)
   - However, this could potentially trap me because:
     * Cell (2,3) is already visited (it's clue 1)
     * I'd need to carefully navigate to avoid blocking myself
     * The upper rows (0,1) would still need to be accessed
   
   Looking at the board structure more carefully:
   - Rows 0 and 1 are completely empty (12 cells)
   - Row 2 has cells at positions (2,4) empty
   - Row 3 has cells at positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) empty
   
   If I go to (2,4), I could then go to (2,3)... wait, no! (2,3) is already visited as clue 1.
   
   So from (2,4), I would need to go to either (1,4) or (3,4). But (3,4) is not adjacent to (2,4)... let me recheck.
   From (2,4), valid moves would be: (1,4), (2,3)-visited, (3,4), (2,5)-visited
   So from (2,4) I could go to (1,4) or (3,4).
   
   If I go to (1,5) first:
   - From (1,5) I can go to (0,5), (1,4), or (2,5)-visited
   - This allows me to sweep through the top rows systematically
   
4. DECISION:
   Moving to (1,5) is the better choice because:
   - It opens up access to rows 0 and 1 which are completely empty
   - I can systematically fill the top portion of the board
   - It provides more flexibility for creating a continuous path
   - From the top, I can work my way down through the remaining empty cells in the middle section

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:49:52,039 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 20:49:52,040 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,5) and have filled 17 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:
   - I'm at the top-right corner (0,5)
   - I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
   - I have 19 more cells to fill
   - Only one available move: (0,4)

2. PATH ANALYSIS:
   Looking at the board, I need to fill all remaining empty cells. The unfilled cells are:
   - Row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)
   - Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)
   - Row 2: (2,4)
   - Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
   - Row 4: (4,1), (4,2)
   - Row 5: (5,4), (5,5)

3. STRATEGY CONSIDERATION:
   Since I only have one legal move (0,4), I must take it. But let me verify this makes sense:
   - From (0,5), moving to (0,4) keeps me in the top row
   - I need to eventually fill all of row 0 and row 1
   - I also need to get back down to fill (5,4) and (5,5) and the middle sections
   
4. FUTURE PATH PLANNING:
   After moving to (0,4), I should continue filling the top rows systematically. A good strategy would be to:
   - Continue left along row 0
   - Snake down to row 1
   - Work my way back to fill the remaining middle cells
   - End at (5,5) or (5,4)

5. DECISION:
   Move to (0,4) is the only legal option and it's a sound strategic choice as it allows me to fill the top row systematically.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 20:51:23,130 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 21 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze my situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (0,1)
   - Cells filled: 21/36, so I need to fill 15 more cells
   - I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
   - Available moves: (1,1) and (0,0)
   
2. REMAINING CELLS TO FILL:
   Looking at the board, the unfilled cells are:
   - Row 0: (0,0)
   - Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)
   - Row 2: (2,4)
   - Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
   - Row 4: (4,1), (4,2)
   - Row 5: (5,4), (5,5)
   
   That's 15 cells remaining, which matches what I need to fill.

3. STRATEGY CONSIDERATION:
   Since I've visited all clues, I need to create a path that visits all remaining cells exactly once. The key is to avoid creating isolated regions or dead ends before all cells are filled.
   
   Let me trace what happens with each option:
   
   Option A: Move to (1,1)
   - From (1,1), I could continue to (1,0), (1,2), or (2,1) [but (2,1) is already visited]
   - If I go (1,1) -> (1,0), I'd be in a corner with only one exit back to (1,1), but (1,1) would already be visited - DEAD END
   - If I go (1,1) -> (1,2), I can continue building the path through row 1
   
   Option B: Move to (0,0)
   - From (0,0), I can only move to (1,0) (since (0,1) is already visited)
   - From (1,0), I could go to (1,1)
   - This creates a path: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> ...
   
4. EVALUATION:
   Let me think about the connectivity. Looking at the remaining cells:
   - The top-left region (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) forms a connected group
   - Row 2: (2,4) is isolated but connects to (1,4) and (3,4)
   - Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) forms a line
   - Row 4: (4,1), (4,2) connects below row 3
   - Row 5: (5,4), (5,5) are at the bottom right
   
   If I move to (0,0) first:
   Path would be: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> ... then I'd need to reach (5,4) and (5,5)
   
   From (4,2), I cannot reach (5,4) and (5,5) without revisiting cells!
   
   If I move to (1,1) first:
   I need to come back and get (0,0) and (1,0) later, but that creates a dead-end problem.
   
   Actually, let me reconsider: If I go (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> ... I handle the corner properly and can then snake through the rest.

I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 21 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (0,1)
   - Cells filled: 21/36 (15 cells remaining)
   - I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
   - Since I've visited all clues, I now need to fill the remaining empty cells to complete the puzzle

2. REMAINING CELLS TO VISIT:
   Looking at the board, the unfilled cells are:
   - (0,0) - adjacent to my current position
   - (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) - the entire row 1
   - (2,4) - one cell in row 2
   - (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) - several cells in row 3
   - (4,1), (4,2) - two cells in row 4
   - (5,4), (5,5) - two cells in row 5

3. AVAILABLE MOVES:
   - (1,1): Moving here would place me in the middle of row 1, which has many unfilled cells
   - (0,0): Moving here would take me to the corner, which could be a dead end if not planned carefully

4. EVALUATION:
   - If I move to (0,0), I'll be in a corner with only one exit (0,1), which I've already visited. This would be a dead end and make the puzzle unsolvable.
   - If I move to (1,1), I can continue exploring row 1 and have multiple options to continue the path. From (1,1), I could access (1,0), (1,2), or (2,1) (but (2,1) is already visited).

5. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:
   I need to ensure I can visit all remaining cells. Moving to (0,0) would trap me immediately since all adjacent cells would be visited. Moving to (1,1) keeps the path alive and allows me to potentially visit (1,0) next, then snake through the remaining cells.

DECISION: Moving to (1,1) is the only viable option that doesn't immediately trap me. From there, I can continue to (1,0), then work my way through the remaining unfilled cells.

   - If I move to (1,1), I can continue exploring row 1 and have multiple options to continue the path. From (1,1), I could access (1,0), (1,2), or (2,1) (but (2,1) is already visited).

5. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:
   I need to ensure I can visit all remaining cells. Moving to (0,0) would trap me immediately since all adjacent cells would be visited. Moving to (1,1) keeps the path alive and allows me to potentially visit (1,0) next, then snake through the remaining cells.

DECISION: Moving to (1,1) is the only viable option that doesn't immediately trap me. From there, I can continue to (1,0), then work my way through the remaining unfilled cells.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 20:51:58,274 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,1)
- Progress: 22/36 cells filled, so 14 cells remain
- I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
- Available moves: (1,0) or (1,2)

Let me visualize what cells are still empty:
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) - 4 empty cells
- Row 2: (2,4) - 1 empty cell
- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) - 4 empty cells
- Row 4: (4,1), (4,2) - 2 empty cells
- Row 5: (5,4), (5,5) - 2 empty cells
Total: 13 empty cells + current position = 14 cells to fill

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all clues, I need to create a path that fills all remaining empty cells and ends at a valid position. I need to be careful not to trap myself.

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (1,0)
- This moves to the left edge
- From (1,0), I could only move to (0,0) (the only adjacent empty cell)
- From (0,0), I would be trapped with no valid moves (all adjacent cells already visited)
- This would create a dead end with 12 cells still unfilled
- BAD CHOICE - leads to immediate dead end

Option B: Move to (1,2)
- This moves right, toward the center
- From (1,2), I could move to (1,3) or potentially connect to other empty areas
- This keeps more options open
- Looking ahead: (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (5,2) is already filled... wait
- Let me recalculate: From (1,2) I can go to (1,3), and from there continue filling row 1 and then work down

Let me trace a potential path from (1,2):
(1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> ... I need to end at (5,5) or (5,4), and I need to visit (1,0) and (0,0) still.

Actually, if I go (1,2) first, I can work my way through the middle, but I'll need to loop back to get (1,0) and (0,0).

Wait, let me reconsider. After checking the board more carefully, (1,0) leads to (0,0) which is a corner with only one exit back to (1,0). If I go there now, I trap myself.

4. DECISION:
Move to (1,2) is the only viable option. Going to (1,0) would immediately create a dead end since (0,0) would trap me.

2025-12-10 20:52:15,451 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,2)
- Progress: 23/36 cells filled, so 13 cells remain
- I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
- Available move: Only (1,3)

Looking at the visual board, the unfilled cells are:
- Row 0: (0,0)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,3), (1,4)
- Row 2: (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,1), (4,2)
- Row 5: (5,4), (5,5)

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've visited all clues (1 and 2), I now need to fill the remaining 13 empty cells and end at clue 2's position, which I've already passed. Wait - I need to re-read the rules. The path should END at the highest numbered clue, which is clue 2 at (3,0). But I've already visited (3,0) at step 5 of my path!

Actually, looking at the path again, I started at clue 1 (2,3) and visited clue 2 (3,0) in order. Now I need to continue filling all remaining cells. The endpoint doesn't need to be exactly at clue 2 - I just needed to visit it in sequence, which I did.

3. EVALUATION:
From (1,2), I can only move to (1,3) according to the available moves.
- (1,3) is empty and needs to be filled
- This connects me toward (1,4) and potentially allows me to sweep through the remaining unfilled areas

Let me trace what needs to be filled:
- (1,3), (1,4), (1,0), (0,0) in row 0-1
- (2,4) in row 2
- (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) in row 3
- (4,1), (4,2) in row 4
- (5,4), (5,5) in row 5

4. DECISION:
Since (1,3) is the only available move, I must take it. From (1,3), I should be able to continue to (1,4), then potentially down to (2,4), and work my way through the remaining empty cells in the middle section of the board, eventually reaching (1,0) and (0,0) to complete the puzzle.

2025-12-10 20:52:29,958 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) and have filled 24 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. **Current Status**: I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0)) in the correct order, so I've completed the mandatory clue sequence.

2. **Remaining Cells**: I need to fill 12 more cells (36 - 24 = 12).

3. **Available Move**: Only (1,4) is available from my current position (1,3).

4. **Unvisited Cells Analysis**: Looking at the board, the unvisited cells are:
   - (0,0)
   - (1,4)
   - (2,4)
   - (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
   - (4,1), (4,2)
   - (5,4), (5,5)

5. **Path Connectivity Check**: From (1,4), I need to ensure I can reach all remaining cells without getting trapped. The unvisited cells form several regions:
   - Top-left corner: (0,0)
   - Middle column: (1,4), (2,4)
   - Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
   - Row 4: (4,1), (4,2)
   - Bottom-right: (5,4), (5,5)

6. **Strategy**: Since I only have one available move (1,4), I must take it. From (1,4), I can move to (2,4) or (0,4) - but (0,4) is already visited, so I'll likely need to go to (2,4). This will connect me to the middle section of the board.

7. **Future Path Planning**: After moving to (1,4), I'll need to carefully navigate to (0,0) and then sweep through the remaining cells in rows 3-5. The path should be something like: (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> ... and eventually reach (0,0) and fill (5,4), (5,5).

Since (1,4) is the only available move, this is straightforward.

From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-12-10 20:52:48,524 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,4) and have filled 25 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. **Current Status**: I've visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0)) and now need to fill the remaining 11 empty cells to complete the puzzle.

2. **Empty Cells Remaining**: Looking at the board, the empty cells are:
   - (0,0)
   - (2,4)
   - (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
   - (4,1), (4,2)
   - (5,4), (5,5)

3. **Available Move**: From (1,4), I can only move to (2,4) (the only available adjacent cell).

4. **Path Planning**: After moving to (2,4), I need to ensure I can reach all remaining empty cells. Let me trace a potential path:
   - From (2,4), I can go to (3,4)
   - From (3,4), I can go to (3,3)
   - From (3,3), I can go to (3,2)
   - From (3,2), I can go to (3,1)
   - From (3,1), I can go to (4,1)
   - From (4,1), I can go to (4,2)
   - From (4,2), I can go to (5,2) - wait, that's already filled
   - Actually from (4,2), I need to go to (5,4) somehow... but that's not adjacent
   
Let me reconsider: From (3,1), I could go to (4,1), then (4,2), but then I'm stuck because (5,2) is already filled and I can't reach (5,4) and (5,5).

Actually, let me think differently. From (3,1), instead of going down, I could go up to (2,4) first... but wait, I need to plan this more carefully.

5. **Correct Strategy**: 
   - Move to (2,4) (only option)
   - From (2,4), move to (3,4)
   - From (3,4), move to (5,4) through (4,4)? No, (4,4) is already filled.
   - From (3,4), move to (3,3)
   - From (3,3), move to (3,2)
   - From (3,2), move to (3,1)
   - From (3,1), move to (4,1)
   - From (4,1), move to (4,2)
   - From (4,2), move to (5,4)? Not adjacent.
   
Wait, I need to reconsider the path. Let me check which cells connect to (5,4) and (5,5):
- (5,4) connects to (5,3) [filled], (5,5), (4,4) [filled]
- (5,5) connects to (5,4), (4,5) [filled]

So to reach (5,4) and (5,5), I must come from the right side or already be there. But (4,4) and (4,5) are filled, and (5,3) is filled. This means (5,4) can only be reached from (5,5), and (5,5) can only be reached from (5,4) or (4,5) [filled].

This creates a problem! Let me re-examine... Actually, I need to reach (5,4) and (5,5) before getting trapped elsewhere.

Given my only option is (2,4), let me move there and continue planning.

2025-12-10 20:53:07,137 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,4) and have filled 26 out of 36 cells. Let me analyze the situation:

1. CURRENT SITUATION:
   - I'm at (2,4) with only one available move: (3,4)
   - I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
   - I have 10 remaining cells to fill: (0,0), (1,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (5,4), (5,5)

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since I've visited all clues, I now need to complete the path by visiting all remaining empty cells
   - I must ensure my path doesn't trap me before visiting all 36 cells
   - The path must remain continuous

3. EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVE:
   - Only option: (3,4)
   - This move goes down one row to (3,4)
   - From (3,4), I would be able to access (3,3) to the left
   - This is the only logical continuation of my path

4. FUTURE PATH CONSIDERATION:
   Looking at the remaining cells after moving to (3,4):
   - From (3,4), I can go to (3,3)
   - From (3,3), I can go to (3,2)
   - From (3,2), I can go to (3,1)
   - From (3,1), I can go to (4,1)
   - From (4,1), I can go to (4,2)
   - From (4,2), I can go to (5,2)? No, (5,2) is already visited at step 9
   - Actually from (4,1), I should consider going to (5,1)? No, (5,1) is visited
   - From (4,2), I need to reach (5,4) and (5,5)
   
   Let me reconsider: After (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2), I need to get to (5,4) and (5,5), and also (1,0) and (0,0).
   
   Actually, I should trace more carefully:
   - Remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (5,4), (5,5)
   - From (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> then I need to reach (5,4), (5,5), (1,0), (0,0)
   - From (4,2), I cannot reach (5,4) directly without revisiting cells
   
   Wait, let me think about this differently. After (4,2), I could go to (5,4) by going through... no, there's no direct path without revisiting.
   
   Let me reconsider the entire remaining path. The key is that (1,0) and (0,0) are isolated in the top-left, and (5,4), (5,5) are in the bottom-right corner. I need to make sure I can reach all of them.

Since (3,4) is my only option, I must take it and plan the rest carefully.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:53:25,080 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,4)
- Filled: 27/36 cells (9 cells remaining)
- I've already visited both clues (1 at (2,3) and 2 at (3,0))
- Available move: only (3,3)

Looking at the visual board, the empty cells are:
- (1,0)
- (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
- (4,1), (4,2)
- (5,4), (5,5)

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to fill all remaining 9 empty cells in one continuous path without getting trapped.

3. EVALUATION:
From (3,4), I can only move to (3,3) as it's the only available adjacent cell.

Let me trace what happens if I move to (3,3):
- Move to (3,3) [step 28]
- From (3,3), I could go to (3,2) or potentially (4,3) but (4,3) is already filled
- This would lead me into the row 3-4 empty region

Remaining empty cells after moving to (3,3):
- (1,0)
- (3,1), (3,2)
- (4,1), (4,2)
- (5,4), (5,5)

From (3,3), I need to plan a path that covers:
- (3,2) -> (3,1) (filling row 3)
- Then down to (4,1) -> (4,2) (filling row 4)
- Then I need to reach (1,0), (5,4), and (5,5)

The critical constraint is reaching (1,0) which is isolated in the top-left, and (5,4)-(5,5) in the bottom-right.

4. DECISION:
I have only one legal move: (3,3). This is the only adjacent unvisited cell from my current position.

The path forward from (3,3) should be:
(3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) is blocked... wait, let me reconsider.

Actually from (3,1) I could go to (4,1), then (4,2), then I need to find a way back up to (1,0) and down to (5,4)-(5,5).

From (4,2), I could go to (5,2) which is filled, so I'd need to go back or to (4,1). This seems tricky. Let me think about connectivity.

The move to (3,3) is mandatory as it's the only option.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 20:55:27,346 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,5)
- Cells filled: 2/36
- Path so far: (0,5) -> (1,5)
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (5,1)
- Available moves: (2,5) or (1,4)

2. STRATEGY:
I need to reach clue 2 at position (5,1). From (1,5), I need to navigate down and to the left. The challenge is to create a path that:
- Reaches clue 2 at (5,1)
- Then continues to clue 3 at (0,3)
- Then clue 4 at (3,4)
- Then clue 5 at (3,3)
- Finally clue 6 at (1,1)
- All while visiting every cell exactly once

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (2,5)
- Pros: Moves down towards clue 2, keeps right edge available for later
- Cons: Need to ensure I can still reach all 36 cells

Option B: Move to (1,4)
- Pros: Moves left, could start working across the board
- Cons: Leaves corner (2,5) which might be difficult to incorporate later without creating dead ends

Looking at the overall puzzle structure, I need to be very careful about corners and edges. The cell (2,5) is in the right edge, and if I don't visit it now, I might get trapped later. Moving to (1,4) would leave (2,5) as a potential dead-end corner that could only be accessed from (1,5) or (2,4), but I've already passed (1,5).

4. DECISION:
I should move to (2,5) to continue down the right edge. This prevents creating an inaccessible corner and keeps my path flexible. From (2,5), I can continue down or move left, maintaining options to eventually reach clue 2 at (5,1) while filling all cells.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (5,5)

   - Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (0,5), moved down the right column to (5,5)

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,4)
- Progress: 7/36 cells filled
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (0,5), went down the right column to (5,5), then moved left to (5,4)
- Clues identified on board:
  - Clue 1: (0,5) - already visited (start)
  - Clue 2: (5,1) - NOT YET VISITED
  - Clue 3: (0,3) - NOT YET VISITED
  - Clue 4: (3,4) - NOT YET VISITED
  - Clue 5: (3,3) - NOT YET VISITED
  - Clue 6: (1,1) - NOT YET VISITED

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (5,1)
- From (5,4), I need to move left along row 5 to reach (5,1)
- Available moves: (4,4) goes up, (5,3) goes left toward clue 2

3. EVALUATION:
- Move (4,4): Goes up to row 4. This moves away from clue 2 at (5,1) which is in the same row I'm currently in. If I go up now, I'll need to come back down later to reach clue 2, potentially creating path conflicts.
  
- Move (5,3): Continues left along row 5, directly toward clue 2 at (5,1). This is the most direct path to the next required clue. From (5,3), I can continue to (5,2), then (5,1) to reach clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Move (5,3) is clearly the better choice because:
- It moves directly toward clue 2, which I must visit next
- It keeps me on row 5, allowing a straight path to (5,1)
- It doesn't create unnecessary detours
- Going up to (4,4) would be counterproductive when my target is on the same row

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (5,3)
- Progress: 8/36 cells filled
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (0,5), went down the right column, then started moving left along the bottom row
- Next clue to visit: Clue 2 at position (5,1)
- Available moves: (4,3) or (5,2)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to reach clue 2 at position (5,1)
- From (5,3), I can either go up to (4,3) or left to (5,2)
- Clue 2 is at (5,1), which is to my left on the same row

- Move (5,2): This moves me left along row 5, getting me closer to clue 2 at (5,1). From (5,2), I can then move to (5,1) to reach clue 2. This is the direct path.
- Move (4,3): This moves me up to row 4. While this doesn't immediately block anything, it takes me away from clue 2 and would require a more circuitous route to reach it. I'd have to come back down later.

Looking at the board layout:
- Clue 3 is at (0,3)
- Clue 4 is at (3,4)
- Clue 5 is at (3,3)
- Clue 6 is at (1,1)

After reaching clue 2 at (5,1), I'll need to navigate to reach clue 3 at (0,3), then work through the remaining clues.

4. DECISION:
Move (5,2) is the best choice because:
- It directly approaches clue 2 at (5,1)
- It maintains efficiency by not deviating from the path to the next required clue
- From (5,2), I can reach (5,1) on the next move to hit clue 2
- This keeps my options open for navigating the rest of the board after visiting clue 2

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (5,0)
- Cells filled: 11/36
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 at (0,5), went down the right column, then moved left across the bottom row
- Only available next move: (4,0) - moving up from current position

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the clues on the board:
- Clue 1: (0,5) - already visited (starting point)
- Clue 3: (0,3) - not yet visited
- Clue 4: (3,4) - not yet visited  
- Clue 5: (3,3) - not yet visited
- Clue 6: (1,1) - not yet visited

Since I've only visited clue 1, I need to find a path that visits the remaining clues in order. However, I notice the visual board shows some numbered cells but I need to focus on reaching the clue numbers in sequence. Looking at the board more carefully, I don't see a clue 2 marked, so the next clue I should aim for is clue 3 at position (0,3).

3. EVALUATION:
- Only one move available: (4,0)
- This move continues upward along the left column
- I need to eventually reach clue 3 at (0,3), then work through the other clues
- Moving to (4,0) keeps me progressing and doesn't trap me

4. DECISION:
Since (4,0) is my only available move, I must take it. This continues my path up the left column. From there, I'll need to navigate across to eventually reach the clues in the middle and upper portions of the board. The strategy will be to fill the left side, then snake across to reach clue 3 at (0,3) and subsequent clues.

2025-12-10 20:58:03,928 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (4,0)
- Cells filled: 12/36
- I started at clue 1 at (0,5) and have been creating a path
- Available clues I can see: 3 at (0,3), 4 at (3,4), 5 at (3,3), 6 at (1,1)
- Since I've filled 12 cells and there's only one clue (clue 1), the numbered clues on the board are just showing the sequence I need to follow, not actual puzzle clues to visit in order.

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the board again:
- The legend shows my path [1] through [12]
- The numbers without brackets (3, 6, 5, 4) appear to be clue numbers I need to visit
- But the rules say start at clue 1 (which I did at (0,5)) and visit clues in ascending order

Actually, reviewing the visual board more carefully:
- Position (0,3) has "3"
- Position (1,1) has "6" 
- Position (3,3) has "5"
- Position (3,4) has "4"

This seems inconsistent with "visit clues in ascending order" since I should visit 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in sequence. Let me assume I need to eventually pass through these clue positions.

2. STRATEGY:
Since there's only clue 1 listed in the clue locations, and I've already started from there, my main goal is to fill all 36 cells without getting trapped. The numbers on the board might just be reference markers.

My available moves are:
- (3,0) - moving up
- (4,1) - moving right

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (3,0) (up)
- This continues along the left edge
- Leaves (4,1) accessible for later
- Would allow me to continue upward along column 0
- Could then move right across row 3, 2, 1, or 0
- This seems to give more flexibility

Option B: Move to (4,1) (right)
- Moves into the interior of the board
- From (4,1), I could go to (4,2), (3,1), or back to (4,0) (already visited)
- This starts filling the middle section
- Could potentially trap me if I'm not careful about the path

4. DECISION:
Given that I have 24 more cells to fill, I need to think about covering the entire board systematically. Moving to (3,0) keeps me on the edge and allows me to potentially sweep across rows more systematically. This is generally a safer strategy in path puzzles - work the edges first, then fill the interior.

Moving up to (3,0) allows me to continue up the left column to (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), and then I can snake across the top and work my way through the remaining cells.

  - Clue 3: (0,3) - not yet visited
  - Clue 5: (3,3) - not yet visited
  - Clue 6: (1,1) - not yet visited
  - Clue 4: (3,4) - not yet visited

Since I've visited clue 1, I need to visit the remaining clues in order. However, I notice there's no clue 2 visible on the board, which means I need to continue my path and it will naturally pass through where clue 2 should be, or clue 2 might already be part of my path.

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the clues more carefully:
- The next unvisited clue appears to be clue 3 at (0,3)
- Then clue 4 at (3,4)
- Then clue 5 at (3,3)
- Then clue 6 at (1,1)

Wait, let me reconsider - I need to visit clues in order. Since I'm at step 13 and started at clue 1, I need to figure out which clues I should visit next.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (3,0):
- (2,0): Moving up the left column
- (3,1): Moving right along row 3

If I move to (2,0): This continues up the left column. I would then need to eventually work my way across and reach the remaining clues.

If I move to (3,1): This moves me right along row 3, which brings me closer to clue 5 at (3,3) and clue 4 at (3,4).

Looking at the clue positions and the need to visit all cells, I need to think about how to efficiently cover the board. The upper-left area (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) is largely unexplored. Clue 6 is at (1,1), clue 3 is at (0,3).

Since I need to fill all 36 cells and visit clues in order, moving to (3,1) would allow me to work across row 3, potentially reaching clues 5 and 4, then working my way up to cover the middle and upper portions of the board.

4. DECISION:
Move to (3,1). This allows me to:
- Work along row 3 toward clues 5 and 4
- Keep options open for covering the unexplored upper-left quadrant
- Maintain a path that can efficiently visit remaining clues in order

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,1)
- Progress: 15/36 cells filled (21 cells remaining)
- Path so far: Started at clue 1 (0,5), went down the right edge, then across the bottom row, and up the left edge to (3,0), then moved right to (3,1) and up to (2,1)
- Available moves: (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the clue numbers:
- Clue 1: (0,5) - already visited (start)
- Clue 3: (0,3) - need to visit
- Clue 4: (4,4) - need to visit after 3
- Clue 5: (3,3) - need to visit after 4
- Clue 6: (1,1) - need to visit after 5

Since I've visited clue 1, I need to head toward clue 3 at (0,3). However, I also need to ensure I can reach all clues in order: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6.

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: (2,0) - Move left
- This moves me to the left edge
- I would need to backtrack or find another path to reach clue 3 at (0,3)
- This could box me in at the left side

Option B: (2,2) - Move right
- Opens up the middle area
- Gives me access to move toward clue 3 at (0,3)
- Maintains flexibility for reaching clues 3, 4, 5, and 6 in order

Option C: (1,1) - Move up
- This is where clue 6 is located!
- But I need to visit clues 3, 4, and 5 BEFORE clue 6
- If I go to (1,1) now, I would visit clue 6 too early in the sequence
- This would violate the rule of visiting clues in ascending order

4. DECISION:
I cannot move to (1,1) because that's where clue 6 is, and I need to visit clues 3, 4, and 5 first.

Moving to (2,0) would box me into the left edge with limited options.

Moving to (2,2) keeps me in the middle area, allowing me to:
- Work my way up and toward clue 3 at (0,3)
- Then navigate to clue 4 at (4,4)
- Then to clue 5 at (3,3)
- Finally to clue 6 at (1,1)

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (1,2)
- Progress: 17/36 cells filled (almost halfway)
- Path has traced: Started at clue 1 (0,5), went down the right column, across the bottom row, came up the left side, and is now moving inward
- Available moves: (0,2), (1,1), (1,3)

2. STRATEGY:
Looking at the clues on the board:
- Clue 1: (0,5) - already visited (start)
- Clue 3: (0,3) - not yet visited
- Clue 4: (3,4) - not yet visited  
- Clue 5: (3,3) - not yet visited
- Clue 6: (1,1) - not yet visited

I need to visit clue numbers in order. Since I started at clue 1, the next clue I should aim for is likely clue 3 at position (0,3), but I should also check if there's a clue 2 that I haven't identified. Looking at the board again, I don't see a clue 2 marked, so the next target should be clue 3 at (0,3).

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: (0,2)
- Pros: Moves up toward row 0, gets closer to clue 3 at (0,3). From (0,2), I could reach (0,3) in one move.
- Cons: Must be careful not to trap myself in the top-left corner. Need to ensure I can still reach all remaining cells.

Option B: (1,1) 
- Pros: This IS clue 6! However, I need to visit clues in order (3, then 4, 5, then 6). Visiting clue 6 now would violate the rule.
- Cons: Wrong order - can't visit clue 6 before clues 3, 4, and 5.

Option C: (1,3)
- Pros: Moves right, keeps options open in the middle of the board
- Cons: Moves away from clue 3, and doesn't create an efficient path toward the next clue

4. DECISION:
I should move to (0,2) because:
- It positions me to reach clue 3 at (0,3) next
- It follows the natural flow of filling the board systematically
- From (0,2), I can reach (0,3) and continue the path efficiently
- It maintains access to all unfilled areas of the board

2025-12-10 20:59:59,459 - INFO - THINKING:

Current situation analysis:
- I'm at position (0,2) after filling 18/36 cells
- I need to fill 18 more cells to complete the puzzle
- Looking at the board, I can see clues at: 1 (already visited at start), 3 at (0,3), 4 at (3,4), 5 at (3,3), and 6 at (1,1)
- Since I started at clue 1, I need to visit the remaining clues in order: next should be clue 2, then 3, 4, 5, 6

Wait, let me recheck the clues on the board:
- Position (0,5): Clue 1 (visited as [1])
- Position (1,5): shows [2] in my path
- Position (2,5): shows [3] in my path
- Position (0,3): shows "3" as a clue
- Position (1,1): shows "6" as a clue
- Position (3,3): shows "5" as a clue
- Position (3,4): shows "4" as a clue

So the clues I need to visit in order are: 1 (done) -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Looking at the legend, [2] and [3] in my path aren't the same as clue numbers. Let me identify actual clue positions:
- Clue 1: (0,5) - visited
- Clue 3: (0,3)
- Clue 4: (3,4)
- Clue 5: (3,3)
- Clue 6: (1,1)

Wait, the puzzle says "Start at clue number 1" and I need to visit clues in ascending order. But I don't see a clue 2 marked on the board. Let me reconsider - perhaps not all numbers from 1 to max are present as clues.

Actually, looking more carefully: the clues are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. So I need to visit: 1 (done) -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

Next target: Clue 3 at position (0,3)

Available moves from (0,2):
1. (0,1) - moves left, away from clue 3
2. (0,3) - moves right, directly to clue 3!

Evaluation:
- Moving to (0,3) takes me directly to the next clue I need to visit
- This is optimal as it follows the rule of visiting clues in ascending order
- After reaching clue 3, I'll need to navigate to clue 4 at (3,4), then 5 at (3,3), then 6 at (1,1)
- Moving to (0,1) would take me away from clue 3 and potentially complicate the path

The clear choice is (0,3) to visit clue 3 next.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 21:00:21,653 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,3) and have filled 19 out of 36 cells. This means I have 17 more cells to fill to complete the puzzle.

Let me analyze my current situation:
- Current position: (0,3)
- Available moves: (1,3) or (0,4)
- Clues to visit: I need to check if there are any more clues beyond clue 1 that I need to visit. Looking at the clue locations, I only see clue 1 at (0,5), which I've already visited as my starting point.

Wait, let me reread the visual board. I see numbers without brackets - these are the clues I need to visit:
- Clue 4 at position (3,4)
- Clue 5 at position (3,3)
- And possibly more clues indicated on the board

Looking more carefully at the board:
Row 3: [13] [14] . 5 4 [4]
Row 4: [12] . . . . [5]

The numbers without brackets are clues! So:
- Clue 4 is at (3,4)
- Clue 5 is at (3,3)
- And I need to visit them in order

But I've already passed by those areas. Let me reconsider - the visual shows my path has already visited position (3,5) as step [4], (4,5) as step [5], etc.

Actually, I need to reinterpret this. The bracketed numbers show my path order, and the unbracketed numbers show clue positions that I still need to visit in sequence.

From the board:
- I see "5" at (3,3) - this is clue 5
- I see "4" at (3,4) - this is clue 4
- I see "6" at (1,1) - this is clue 6

Since I must visit clues in ascending order and I've already visited clue 1, I need to find and visit clue 2 next.

Looking at the board again, I don't see a "2" marked anywhere except in my path. Let me check if there are more clues I'm missing.

Actually, rereading the problem: I started at clue 1 at (0,5). The path shows I've been moving, but I need to visit ALL clues in order. Since only clue 1 is listed in the clue locations section, perhaps the other numbers on the board are just unmarked clues or part of a different notation.

Given the constraint that I have 17 cells left to fill and need to complete the entire 6x6 board, let me think strategically:

Available moves:
1. (1,3) - moves down one row
2. (0,4) - moves right in the top row

If I move to (0,4), I'll be moving along the top row. From (0,4), I could only move to (1,4) since (0,5) and (0,3) are already visited.

If I move to (1,3), I open up more possibilities in the middle section of the board.

Looking at what's left to fill:
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4) in row 0
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,4) in row 1
- (2,0), (2,3), (2,4) in row 2
- (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) in row 3
- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) in row 4

Total unfilled: 17 cells (matches what I need)

Moving to (0,4) would force me into (1,4), then I'd need to snake through the remaining cells. Moving to (1,3) gives me more flexibility to work through the middle section systematically.

- Looking at the board, I can see clue numbers: 1 at (0,5) (already visited as start), and I need to identify other clues
- From the visual board, I can see clue 4 at (3,4), clue 5 at (3,3), clue 6 at (1,1)
- Since I started at clue 1, I should be heading toward the remaining clues in order

2. STRATEGY:
- I've started at clue 1 (0,5) and need to visit clues in ascending order
- Looking at the remaining clues on the board:
  - Clue 5 is at position (3,3)
  - Clue 6 is at position (1,1)
  - Clue 4 appears to be at (3,4)
- Wait, let me reconsider the clue positions from the visual:
  - Row 3: [13] [14] . 5 4 [4]
  - This shows clue 5 at (3,3) and clue 4 at (3,4)
  - Row 1: . 6 [17] [20] . [2]
  - This shows clue 6 at (1,1)

Since I need to visit clues in order and I've already visited clue 1, I should be looking for clue 2, then 3, etc. But looking more carefully at the legend, the numbers in brackets are my path order, and unbracketed numbers are clue positions.

Let me reread: clue 4 is at (3,4), clue 5 is at (3,3), clue 6 is at (1,1).

Since only clue 1 is listed in the clue locations and I started there, perhaps the other numbers shown are not clues but something else? Let me reconsider - the puzzle says "Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order" but only lists clue 1.

Actually, if there's only clue 1, then I just need to fill all 36 cells without revisiting any, starting from clue 1 and ending wherever makes sense.

3. EVALUATION:
From (2,3), I can move to:
- (3,3): Moving down. This would continue the path downward.
- (2,4): Moving right. This would move toward the right side of the board.

Looking at what's left to fill:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,4)
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,4)
- Row 3: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)
- Row 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)

If I go to (2,4):
- I can then go to (1,4) or (3,4)
- This keeps options open for the upper right area

If I go to (3,3):
- I can then go to (3,2), (3,4), or (4,3)
- This commits me to the middle/lower area first

Given that I have unvisited cells in the upper area (rows 0-1) and need to ensure I can reach them all, moving to (2,4) allows me to potentially sweep through (1,4), (0,4), then work my way left through row 0, then come back down through (1,0), (2,0), and finish in the middle area.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (2,4) is strategically better as it maintains access to the upper right corner and allows for a more natural sweeping pattern to cover all remaining cells.

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (2,4)
- Cells filled: 22/36 (14 cells remaining)
- Available moves: (1,4) or (3,4)
- I've completed a path along the right edge, bottom edge, and am now working through the middle sections

2. STRATEGY:
- Looking at the board, I see clue "5" at position (3,3) and clue "4" at position (3,4)
- Wait, I need to check which clues I haven't visited yet
- From the visual board, I can see clue numbers: 1 (visited at start), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- My path shows I've been moving in a specific pattern, but I need to identify which numbered clues are still ahead

Let me map out the clues more carefully:
- Position (0,5): Clue 1 (START - visited)
- Looking at the remaining visible numbers on the board: 4, 5, 6

3. EVALUATION:
Let me trace what's remaining:
- Empty cells at: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)

From (2,4), my options are:
- Move to (1,4): This goes up, toward the top row where I have cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,4) still empty
- Move to (3,4): This goes down, where I see clue "4" is located at position (3,4)

Since I need to visit clues in order and I see clue numbers 4, 5, 6 on the board:
- Clue 4 appears to be at (3,4)
- Clue 5 appears to be at (3,3)
- Clue 6 appears to be at (1,1)

Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the path, I started at clue 1. The numbered clues visible are at specific positions. Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order, and I'm at step 22 of 36, I should be looking for the next clue to visit.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (3,4) would take me to where clue "4" is located. This seems like the logical next step if I need to visit clue 4 next. Moving to (1,4) would take me upward and potentially trap me from accessing the lower cells where clues 4 and 5 are located.

The move to (3,4) allows me to:
- Visit clue 4 (if that's the next clue)
- Continue to clue 5 at (3,3)
- Then work my way back up through the remaining cells

2025-12-10 21:02:07,351 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Analysis:**
- I'm at position (3,4) with 23/36 cells filled
- I need to fill 13 more cells to complete the puzzle
- The only clue visible is clue 1 at (0,5), which I started from
- Available moves: (4,4) and (3,3)

**Examining the Board:**
Looking at the visual board, I can see:
- Row 0: positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,4) are empty
- Row 1: positions (1,0), (1,4) are empty  
- Row 2: position (2,0) is empty
- Row 3: position (3,2) is empty
- Row 4: positions (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are empty

**Path Remaining:**
I need to visit 13 more cells. Let me trace what's left:
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- (1,0), (1,4)
- (2,0)
- (3,2), (3,3)
- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)

**Evaluating Available Moves:**

**Option 1: Move to (4,4)**
- This moves me down and continues along row 4
- From (4,4), I could go to (4,3) continuing left along row 4
- This would allow me to sweep through the empty cells in row 4: (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1)
- Then I could go up to reach the remaining cells

**Option 2: Move to (3,3)**
- This moves me left into row 3
- From (3,3), I would need to visit (3,2) eventually
- But looking at connectivity, if I go to (3,3), I could go to (3,2), then up to (2,2)... wait, (2,2) is already filled [16]
- From (3,3), I could go to (4,3), but then I'd need to backtrack through row 4
- Or from (3,3) I could go to (2,3)... wait, (2,3) is already filled [21]

Let me think about the optimal path completion:

If I go to **(4,4)**:
- Path: (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1)... wait (3,1) is filled [14]
- Let me reconsider: (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) is blocked
- So: (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> then I'd need to go to (3,1) which is blocked
- Actually, from (4,1) I can only go to (4,2) [blocked], (4,0) [filled as 12], (3,1) [filled as 14], or (5,1) [filled as 10]
- This seems problematic!

If I go to **(3,3)**:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Analysis:**
- I'm at position  with 23/36 cells filled
- I need to fill 13 more cells to complete the puzzle
- The only clue visible is clue 1 at , which I started from
- Available moves:  and 

**Examining the Board:**
Looking at the visual board, I can see:
- Row 0: positions , ,  are empty
- Row 1: positions ,  are empty  
- Row 2: position  is empty
- Row 3: position  is empty
- Row 4: positions , , ,  are empty

**Path Remaining:**
I need to visit 13 more cells. Let me trace what's left:
- , , 
- , 
- 
- , 
- , , , 

**Evaluating Available Moves:**

**Option 1: Move to **
- This moves me down and continues along row 4
- From , I could go to  continuing left along row 4
- This would allow me to sweep through the empty cells in row 4:  ->  -> 
- Then I could go up to reach the remaining cells

**Option 2: Move to **
- This moves me left into row 3
- From , I would need to visit  eventually
- But looking at connectivity, if I go to , I could go to , then up to ... wait,  is already filled [16]
- From , I could go to , but then I'd need to backtrack through row 4
- Or from  I could go to ... wait,  is already filled [21]

Let me think about the optimal path completion:

If I go to ****:
- Path:  ->  ->  ->  ->  -> ... wait  is filled [14]
- Let me reconsider:  ->  ->  ->  ->  ->  is blocked
- So:  ->  ->  ->  ->  -> then I'd need to go to  which is blocked
- Actually, from  I can only go to  [blocked],  [filled as 12],  [filled as 14], or  [filled as 10]
- This seems problematic!

If I go to ****:
- From , I could go to  ->  -> ... or to 
- Path option:  ->  ->  -> ... wait  is filled [16]
- So:  ->  ->  ->  -> back doesn't work well
- Or:  ->  ->  ->  ->  ->  -> ... but  becomes isolated

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,4)
- Progress: 23/36 cells filled, so 13 cells remaining
- I've visited clue 1 at (0,5) and need to continue filling the board
- Looking at the board, I can see clue 5 at position (3,3) that I haven't visited yet
- Available moves: (4,4) or (3,3)

2. STRATEGY:
- I need to visit all clues in order. Looking at the visual board, I can see clue 5 at position (3,3)
- Since I must visit clues in ascending order and clue 5 is visible and unvisited, I should head toward it
- After visiting clue 5, I'll need to fill the remaining empty cells

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (4,4)
- This moves away from clue 5 at (3,3)
- Would go into the bottom-right area where cells (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are still empty
- From (4,4), I'd need to backtrack to reach clue 5 at (3,3), which could create path complications
- This delays visiting the next clue

Option B: Move to (3,3) - This is clue 5!
- This directly visits the next required clue (clue 5)
- From (3,3), I can then work on filling the remaining empty cells in the middle section
- Remaining empty cells after this would be: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,0), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
- This keeps me centrally located to access the unfilled areas

4. DECISION:
Moving to (3,3) is clearly the best choice because:
- It visits clue 5, which I must visit in order
- It maintains better connectivity to the remaining empty cells
- It follows the puzzle rule of visiting clues in ascending order
- From (3,3), I'll have access to both the upper-left area and the middle-bottom area to complete the path

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
I am currently at position (3,3) and have filled 24 out of 36 cells. This means I have 12 cells remaining to fill. Looking at the visual board, I can see that I've created a path that has covered most of the perimeter and some internal cells.

**2. STRATEGY - Next Objectives:**
Since there's only one clue (clue 1 at the start), I need to complete a Hamiltonian path that visits all 36 cells exactly once. I need to fill the remaining 12 empty cells.

Let me identify the empty cells:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,4)
- Row 2: (2,0)
- Row 3: (3,2)
- Row 4: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)

**3. EVALUATION of Available Moves:**

From (3,3), I can move to:
- **(4,3)**: This moves down into row 4, where there are 4 consecutive empty cells (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
- **(3,2)**: This moves left to the only empty cell in row 3

Let me analyze each option:

**Option A: Move to (4,3)**
- This enters the middle of row 4's empty section
- From (4,3), I could go to (4,2) or (4,4)
- If I go (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1), I'd need to exit somewhere, likely up to (3,1) which is already filled - BLOCKED
- If I go (4,3) -> (4,4), then I need to handle (4,2) and (4,1) later, which might create issues
- This seems problematic as it splits the row 4 empty cells

**Option B: Move to (3,2)**
- This is the only empty cell in row 3
- From (3,2), I can move to (2,2) [already filled], (4,2), or potentially (3,1) [already filled]
- So from (3,2), I'd be forced to go to (4,2)
- From (4,2), I could go to (4,1) or (4,3)
- This allows me to traverse row 4 in a more organized manner: (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) or (4,3)

Let me trace a potential path from (3,2):
(3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (1,1) [wait, that's a huge jump, not possible]

Actually, from (4,1), I can go to (4,0) [filled] or (4,2) [would be filled]. So I'd need to go somewhere else.

Let me reconsider: (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (4,1)? No, can't jump.

Better path: (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> needs to connect somehow to upper rows

Wait, from (4,1), I could go up to (3,1) [filled], left to (4,0) [filled], right to (4,2) [would be filled], or down to (5,1) [filled]. This creates a dead end!

Let me reconsider (4,3) option:
(4,3) -> (4,4) -> (0,4)? No, too far.
(4,3) -> (4,4) needs to eventually connect to (0,4), (1,4), and the top-left corner cells.

Actually, I should think about this more systematically. The remaining empty cells form disconnected regions that I need to connect.

**4. DECISION:**

After careful analysis, I need to move to **(3,2)** because:
1. It's an isolated cell that must be visited
2. It provides access to row 4's empty cells

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-12-10 21:03:09,819 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS:
- Current position: (3,3)
- Cells filled: 24/36 (12 cells remaining)
- Only clue visible is "1" at (0,5), which I've already visited as my starting point
- Available moves: (4,3) or (3,2)

Looking at the visual board:
- Row 0: cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,4) are empty
- Row 1: cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,4) are empty  
- Row 2: cell (2,0) is empty
- Row 3: cell (3,2) is empty
- Row 4: cells (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are empty

2. STRATEGY:
Since there's only one clue (clue 1) and I've already visited it, my goal now is to fill all remaining 12 cells in a continuous path without getting trapped. I need to ensure I can reach all empty cells.

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (4,3)
- This moves me down to row 4
- From (4,3), I could access (4,2), (4,4), or potentially back up
- Row 4 has 4 empty cells: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
- This could help me sweep through row 4

Option B: Move to (3,2)
- This moves me left in row 3
- From (3,2), I could access (4,2) or (2,2) is already filled
- This is the only empty cell in row 3
- If I don't take this now, I might get trapped later

Let me trace potential paths:

If I go to (3,2):
- From (3,2), I must go to (4,2) (can't go to (2,2) - already visited, can't go to (3,1) - already visited)
- From (4,2), I can access (4,1) or (4,3)
- This allows me to sweep row 4 and then move up to complete rows 0-2

If I go to (4,3):
- From (4,3), I could go to (4,2) or (4,4)
- But then I'd have to eventually come back to get (3,2), which might be difficult
- If I sweep right first to (4,4), then come back through (4,2), I'd need to access (3,2) from (4,2)
- This seems viable too

Critical observation: Cell (3,2) is isolated - it can only be accessed from (3,3) (where I am now) or (4,2). If I move to (4,3) first, I MUST ensure I can still reach (3,2) via (4,2). Let me verify this path works:
- (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) - NO! From (4,3) I can't reach (4,4) and then (4,2) without revisiting (4,3)
- (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) - This works!

Both paths seem viable, but going to (3,2) first is safer because it clears the isolated cell immediately.

4. DECISION:
I should move to (3,2) to clear this isolated cell first. This prevents potential trapping issues later and gives me clearer options to complete the remaining path.

2025-12-10 21:03:23,850 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,2) and have filled 25 out of 36 cells. That means I have 11 more cells to fill to complete the puzzle.

Let me analyze the current situation:
- Current position: (3,2)
- Only available move: (4,2)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,5) (this was my starting position)
- I need to check if there are any other clues I need to visit

Looking at the visual board, I can see that clue 1 is the only numbered clue mentioned in the clue locations. Since I started at clue 1 and the rules state I must visit all clues in ascending order and end at the highest clue, and there's only clue 1, I must simply fill all remaining cells.

Current unfilled cells:
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- (1,0), (1,1), (1,4)
- (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
- (1,3) appears to be position (1,4) based on the layout

Looking at my only available move (4,2), this makes sense as it's the only adjacent unvisited cell. Let me trace what happens if I go there:

From (4,2), I would be in row 4, and I can see cells (4,1), (4,3), and (4,4) are still empty in that row. 

My path strategy should be:
1. Move to (4,2)
2. Continue filling row 4: potentially (4,3) -> (4,4)
3. Then move up to fill the remaining cells in the upper portion

The move to (4,2) is mandatory (it's the only option), and it allows me to continue filling row 4, which will then give me access to move up through (4,4) to reach the unfilled cells in rows 0, 1.

1. ANALYSIS: 
- Current position: (4,2)
- Progress: 26/36 cells filled, so 10 cells remaining
- Available moves: (4,1) or (4,3)
- I've already visited clue 1 at (0,5) and that's the only clue on this board

2. STRATEGY:
Since there's only one clue (clue 1 at the start), my goal now is to fill all remaining 10 empty cells in a continuous path without getting trapped. Let me identify which cells are still empty:
- Row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,4)
- Row 2: (2,0)
- Row 4: (4,1), (4,3), (4,4)

Let me analyze the current situation:

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (4,2)
   - Progress: 26/36 cells filled, so 10 cells remaining
   - Available moves: (4,1) or (4,3)
   - I've already visited clue 1 at (0,5) and need to complete the path

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since clue 1 is the only clue and I've already visited it, I just need to fill all remaining cells
   - Remaining empty cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,0), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4)
   - That's exactly 10 cells, matching what I need to fill
   - I must create a path that visits all these cells without getting trapped

3. EVALUATION:
   
   Option A: Move to (4,1)
   - This moves left to fill cell (4,1)
   - From (4,1), I could go to (4,0) - but (4,0) is already filled [12]
   - From (4,1), I could go to (3,1) - but (3,1) is already filled [14]
   - From (4,1), I could only go to (5,1) - but (5,1) is already filled [10]
   - This would TRAP me immediately! Dead end.

   Option B: Move to (4,3)
   - This moves right to fill cell (4,3)
   - From (4,3), I can go to (4,4) (empty) or (5,3) (filled [8]) or (3,3) (filled [24]) or (4,2) (just came from)
   - So from (4,3), I can continue to (4,4)
   - From (4,4), I can reach (3,4) (filled) or (4,5) (filled) or (4,3) (just came from) or (5,4) (filled)
   - Wait, this also seems problematic...
   
   Let me reconsider (4,3) more carefully:
   - (4,3) -> (4,4) -> then I need to find a way to reach the upper left cells
   - From (4,4), I could potentially work my way up through (3,4) - no, that's filled [23]
   
   Actually, let me trace what cells are still empty and accessible:
   - Upper section: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,0)
   - Current area: (4,1), (4,3), (4,4)
   
   If I go to (4,3) -> (4,4), I need a path back up. The only way up from row 4 is through already-filled cells. But wait - I need to check connections more carefully.
   
   From (4,3), if I go to (4,4), then from (4,4) I'm stuck (all neighbors filled or would be my previous position).
   
   Let me reconsider the entire remaining path. I need to connect to the upper empty cells. Looking at the board, (2,0) connects to (1,0), and the upper left area is still completely empty.
   
   Actually, if I go (4,1), I realize I'd be trapped immediately as analyzed.
   
   So (4,3) is the only viable option, even if it seems constrained.

4. DECISION:
   Move to (4,3) is the only option that doesn't immediately trap me. From there, I'll continue to (4,4) and then need to find a way to snake back to fill the remaining upper-left cells.

Since there's only clue 1 and I've already visited it at the start, I just need to complete a Hamiltonian path through all remaining cells. The path must be continuous and visit each empty cell exactly once.

4. EVALUATION OF (4,4):
- This is the only available move from (4,3)
- From (4,4), I can reach (3,4) [already visited] or (4,5) [already visited]
- Wait, let me reconsider: From (4,4), the adjacent cells are:
  - (3,4) - already visited [23]
  - (5,4) - already visited [7]
  - (4,3) - already visited (current came from here)
  - (4,5) - already visited [5]

This seems problematic. Let me check (4,1) which is empty:
- From (4,3), I cannot directly reach (4,1) - there's (4,2) in between which is already visited [26]

Actually, looking more carefully at available moves from (4,3):
- (4,2) - already visited [26]
- (4,4) - empty, available
- (3,3) - already visited [24]
- (5,3) - already visited [8]

So (4,4) is indeed the only available move.

5. PATH PLANNING:
After moving to (4,4), I need to find a way to visit the remaining 8 cells:
(0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,4), (2,0), (4,1)

From (4,4), I'll need to navigate carefully. Let me trace what's possible:
- From (4,4), I might go up to connect with the upper portion of the board through (3,4) [already visited - blocked]
- This reveals a potential issue in path planning

Wait, I need to reconsider the path. After (4,4), looking at adjacent cells that aren't visited:
None directly from (4,4) are unvisited except... let me verify the board state again.

Given the constraint and that (4,4) is the only option, I must take it and figure out the continuation from there.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

Current Position: (4,4)
Cells filled: 28/36
Remaining cells: 8

Looking at the visual board, let me identify which cells are still empty (marked with "."):
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- (1,0), (1,4)
- (2,0)
- (4,1)

That's 7 empty cells plus my current position makes 28 filled cells total, which matches.

From position (4,4), I can move to:
- (3,4) - Already visited [23]
- (5,4) - Already visited [7]
- (4,3) - Already visited [27]
- (4,5) - Already visited [5]

Wait, the puzzle says "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" - this suggests I'm in a deadlock. Let me verify this.

Actually, looking more carefully at the board state, from (4,4) all adjacent cells have been visited:
- Up: (3,4) is [23]
- Down: (5,4) is [7]
- Left: (4,3) is [27]
- Right: (4,5) is [5]

This appears to be a stuck position. However, let me reconsider if there's been an error in the path taken.

Looking at the remaining unvisited cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,4), (2,0), (4,1)

These 7 cells need to be visited, but from position (4,4), I cannot reach any of them without revisiting already-visited cells.

The issue is that the path has created isolated regions. The cells in the upper left area (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0) and upper right (0,4), (1,4), and middle (4,1) are now unreachable from the current position without breaking the rules.

This indicates that an earlier move in the path was suboptimal and has led to this deadlock. Unfortunately, from the current position (4,4), there are NO valid moves available that follow the puzzle rules.

MOVE: Unable to move - the puzzle is in a deadlock state. The path taken has isolated the remaining 7 unvisited cells, making them unreachable from position (4,4) without revisiting already-visited cells, which violates the rules.

To solve this puzzle, we would need to backtrack and choose a different path earlier in the sequence to ensure all cells remain accessible.

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

**Current Status:**
- Position: (4,4)

**Remaining Empty Cells:**
Looking at the visual board:
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4) - top row
- (1,0), (1,4) - second row  
- (2,0) - third row
- (4,1) - fifth row

That's 7 empty cells, but I need to fill 8 more cells total (36 - 28 = 8).

Wait, let me recount the path taken: The path has 28 steps, so 28 cells are filled. I need to fill 36 total, so 8 more cells remain.

**Available Moves from (4,4):**
From position (4,4), I can move to:
- (4,5) - Already visited (step 5)
- (4,3) - Already visited (step 27)
- (3,4) - Already visited (step 23)
- (5,4) - Already visited (step 7)

All adjacent cells have been visited! This means I'm stuck.

**Analysis of the Problem:**
Looking at the path, I can see that I've created a situation where (4,4) is surrounded by already-visited cells. The remaining unvisited cells are:
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- (1,0), (1,4)
- (2,0)
- (4,1)

These 7 cells are disconnected from my current position (4,4). There's no way to reach them without revisiting cells.

**Root Cause:**
The issue occurred when I moved from (4,3) to (4,4). This created an isolated endpoint with no way to continue to the remaining empty cells. The cell (4,1) is empty and would have been a better continuation point from earlier in the path.

**Conclusion:**
The puzzle is in an unsolvable state from the current position. The path needs to be reconsidered from an earlier point. Specifically, the path should have gone through (4,1) before getting trapped at (4,4).

However, since you're asking for the next move from the current position, and there are no valid moves available (all adjacent cells are already visited), I cannot provide a valid move.

MOVE: No valid move available - the puzzle is stuck and needs backtracking to an earlier position to find an alternative path.

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

Current position: (4,4)
Cells filled: 28/36
Cells remaining: 8

Looking at the visual board, let me identify which cells are still empty (marked with "."):
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- (1,0), (1,4)
- (2,0)
- (4,1)

That's 7 empty cells, plus my current position makes 8 cells total to complete.

From position (4,4), my available moves are:
1. (4,5) - Already visited (step 5)
2. (3,4) - Already visited (step 23)
3. (5,4) - Already visited (step 7)
4. (4,3) - Already visited (step 27)

Wait, the puzzle states "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" - let me verify this.

Looking at all four adjacent cells to (4,4):
- North: (3,4) = step [23] - visited
- South: (5,4) = step [7] - visited
- East: (4,5) = step [5] - visited
- West: (4,3) = step [27] - visited

All adjacent cells have been visited. This means I am indeed stuck!

However, this suggests there might be an error in the path taken. Let me trace back to see where the issue occurred.

Looking at the board more carefully, I need to find if there was a better path earlier that would have allowed me to fill all 36 cells.

The issue is that I'm boxed in at (4,4) with all surrounding cells already visited. The remaining empty cells are:
- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)
- (1,0), (1,4)
- (2,0)
- (4,1)

These cells are now unreachable from my current position.

Since I'm genuinely stuck with no valid moves available, this puzzle state represents a dead-end. The path taken has blocked itself from completing the puzzle.

MOVE: No valid move available - the current path has led to a dead end at position (4,4) with 8 cells remaining unreachable.
