Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-11-23 20:29:52,218 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (2,3), which is the start of my path and also the location of Clue 1. My progress so far is 1/16 cells filled, meaning I've only visited one clue out of all 16 cells.

**STRATEGY:** Since I need to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order, I should head towards Clue 2 next. After analyzing the board, I notice that Clue 2 is located at position (3,1).

**EVALUATION:**

- **Move 1: (1,3):** This move would take me diagonally to the right and down. While it's not against any rules, it doesn't directly bring me closer to Clue 2 or advance my path in a way that fills empty cells efficiently.
  
- **Move 2: (3,3):** Moving to the bottom-right corner from my current position would take me away from the direct path towards Clue 2 and not fill any of the necessary intermediate cells.

- **Move 3: (2,2):** This move keeps me somewhat central but doesn't directly advance towards Clue 2. It does, however, keep options open for future moves that could potentially be more efficient if the correct path to Clue 2 isn't immediately clear.

Given these considerations, none of the available moves perfectly aligns with advancing my path in a straightforward manner to reach Clue 2 from Clue 1 without revisiting cells or moving diagonally. However, considering the goal of visiting every clue in ascending order and filling empty cells as needed, I will choose the move that best sets up for future options.

**DECISION:**

The optimal choice seems to be **Move: (3,1)** is not among my options, but since I need to evaluate each option based on its pros and cons:

Given the available moves are (1,3), (3,3), and (2,2), considering efficiency in moving towards Clue 2 without revisiting cells or creating unnecessary dead ends, the most strategic move seems to be **(2,2)**. This keeps options open for future moves that could more efficiently reach Clue 2 by potentially allowing a direct route once additional clues are filled.

2025-11-23 20:30:01,195 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,3) and have filled only 1 cell out of 16. The goal is to visit every clue number in ascending order. Clue 2 needs to be visited next, which is located at an unknown position but it must be a valid move from my current location.

From the available moves: (1,3), (3,3), or (2,2), I will evaluate each option.

**Option (1,3)**:
Moving to (1,3) would allow me to visit clue 2 if it is located at position (1,2) or any other valid location that allows me to go up or right from there. However, without knowing the exact location of clue 2, I risk moving in a direction that might block future paths.

**Option (3,3)**:
Moving to (3,3) would put me at the top-right corner of the board, which could be useful for exploring other parts of the board. But this move would not bring me closer to clue 2 and could potentially isolate me from moving towards it easily.

**Option (2,2)**:
Moving to (2,2) seems like a safe option as it doesn't block any immediate paths but it also does not seem to offer an advantage in terms of moving towards clue 2 directly. However, without more information about the board and the exact locations of other clues, this could be a viable choice.

Given the available options, I'll choose (1,3) because it's one of the most straightforward moves that allows me to progress horizontally or vertically towards an unknown but presumably needed direction for clue 2.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-11-23 20:30:18,444 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) and have filled 2 out of 16 cells. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from 1. I've already visited clue 1 located at (2,3). According to the rules, my next move should be to the next higher-numbered clue. Since there are only two clues so far, the next one would be Clue 2.

STRATEGY:
I need to find Clue 2, which is currently unknown but must exist between (1,3) and the highest numbered clue (which we don't know yet). Given that I'm already at position (1,3), my strategy should focus on finding a path towards potentially higher-numbered clues while ensuring the path remains continuous.

EVALUATION:
For each available move: 
- Available Next Moves are (0,3) and (1,2).
- Moving to (0,3): This would place me one row above my current position, which doesn't necessarily bring me closer to higher-numbered clues since I don't know where they might be. It also does not immediately advance the path towards any specific clue number.
- Moving to (1,2): This move places me diagonally up and right from my current position at (1,3). However, considering the strict horizontal/vertical movement rule, this move could potentially align with moving towards a higher row or column that might house Clue 2.

DECISION:
Given the situation, I should try to advance in a direction that is most likely to expose more of the board while keeping an eye on visiting clues in ascending order. Since I don't have exact positions for future clues but want to move closer to them without assuming any particular direction, moving to (1,2) seems prudent. This move does not immediately block off paths or force me into a corner and maintains flexibility as we continue the puzzle.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

* Move to (0,2):
	+ Pro: Fill an empty cell at the top-left corner.
	+ Con: This move doesn't bring me closer to clue 4 or any subsequent clues.
* Move to (2,2):
	+ Pro: Fill a diagonal cell that could potentially be used for a future clue.
	+ Con: This move takes me away from the horizontal path and might limit future options.
* Move to (1,1):
	+ Pro: Bring myself closer to the top-left corner, which can be used as a placeholder for subsequent clues.
	+ Con: None notable.

2025-11-23 20:30:35,813 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2), which is two rows above and one column left of the starting clue [4] at (0,3). I have filled 4/16 cells so far. According to the puzzle rules, my next move should be to visit the next highest numbered clue, which is Clue 2.

STRATEGY:
The location of Clue 2 can help guide our decision-making process. Since we've already visited Clue 1 at position (2,3), the next logical step is to find Clue 2's location and navigate towards it. However, looking at the board, there are no direct indications of Clue 2's exact position yet.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Move to (0,1): This would allow us to explore the upper-left corner and potentially make a move that sets us up for visiting future clues. One con is that we wouldn't be directly moving towards any known clue.
* Move to (0,3): This option takes us back to where Clue 4 was located initially. We've already filled some space here, but it's not an optimal choice as we'd essentially be retracing our steps and potentially limiting future options.

DECISION:
Considering the available moves, I believe that moving to (0,1) is the best choice. It allows us to expand our exploration to the upper-left corner of the board without immediately focusing on a specific clue location. This move also maintains flexibility for navigating towards future clues while preventing unnecessary backtracking or limiting our options.

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-11-23 20:30:45,108 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 5 out of 16 cells in a continuous path. The current situation shows that I need to visit higher-numbered clues in ascending order, but there are no consecutive numbers available for the next move. My goal is to get closer to clue 2, which is located at position (1,1) based on the given coordinates.

STRATEGY:
I should aim to visit clue 2 next, as it's the smallest unvisited number that is relatively close to my current location and not isolated from other clues. The next step would be to move towards (1,1), which will allow me to connect with more cells in the future and eventually reach higher-numbered clues.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Move to (0,0): Pros: It's a safe move that doesn't block any paths. Cons: It moves away from the goal of reaching clue 2 at position (1,1).
* Move to (1,1): Pros: Directly reaches the next clue number, gets closer to filling in higher-numbered clues, and opens up more possibilities for future moves. Cons: Moves into a cell that is already part of the path.

DECISION:
Given the analysis and evaluation, moving directly towards the next clue at position (1,1) seems like the best option. This move sets me on track to visit higher-numbered clues in ascending order while considering the current board state and available moves.

MOVE: (0,2)

 Wait, no! I made a mistake! Based on the analysis of available options, moving to (1,1) is actually the better choice since it directly reaches the next clue number.

I am currently at position (0,1), having just moved from (0,2). I have filled 5 out of 16 cells in my path so far. According to the clue locations, the next number I need to visit is Clue 3, which is located at an unknown position.

STRATEGY:
Since the board size is 4x4 and there are 4 rows and columns, Clue 3 can be any of the remaining clues that haven't been visited yet. The only clue we know about is Clue 1, which I've already visited at position (2,3). Therefore, my next goal is to get closer to a potential location for Clue 3.

EVALUATION:
The two available moves are (1,1) and (0,0).

* Moving to (1,1):
	+ Pros: This move gets me closer to the center of the board and opens up possibilities for future moves.
	+ Cons: I'm not directly heading towards a specific clue location yet.
* Moving to (0,0):
	+ Pros: Starting from the top-left corner gives me more flexibility in terms of movement directions.
	+ Cons: This move doesn't seem to contribute directly to finding Clue 3.

DECISION:
Considering my current position and goal of getting closer to a potential location for Clue 3, I think moving to (1,1) is the best option. It allows me to maintain flexibility in terms of movement directions while keeping me on track with visiting the clue numbers in ascending order.

I am currently at position (1,1), and I've filled 6 out of 16 cells. The next clue to visit in ascending order is Clue 2, which is not visible on the current board state but based on the available moves and previous clues, it's likely located at a different position than Clue 1 (which was at position (2,3)). From my current position (1,1), I can see that both possible next moves are adjacent to me: (2,1) is one cell up, and (1,0) is one cell left.

EVALUATION:
- **Move (2,1)**: Pros - This move would put me directly above the current position of Clue 3 which was in a vertical path previously. It could potentially align with the clue's position if I continue that way. Cons - Moving up might limit future horizontal paths or create unnecessary obstacles.
  
- **Move (1,0)**: Pros - This move leaves options for both horizontal and vertical exploration from this point onwards. Cons - Moving left does not directly approach any known clue locations yet.

DECISION:
Based on the available information and previous path taken, it seems that moving up to (2,1) would be beneficial as it aligns with a potential future path towards Clue 3, which could potentially simplify the next steps in solving the puzzle.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-11-23 20:31:18,844 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

**ANALYSIS**: I am currently at position (2,1), having visited clue 1 located at (2,3). My path so far has been (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). I have filled 7 out of 16 cells. The current state of the board is:

  .  [5] [4]   .
  3  [6] [3] [2]
  4  [7]   .  [1]
  .    .    .    .

**STRATEGY**: My next clue to visit in ascending order is Clue 2. According to the board information, Clue 2 is located at an unknown position (row,col). However, since it's the second clue, it must be one cell away from the first clue. Given that the first clue was at (2,3), I will try to deduce its likely location.

Since we are in a 4x4 grid and the clues must be visited in ascending order, Clue 2 should be located such that it's directly adjacent to Clue 1 but does not block any potential path. The only possible location for Clue 2 relative to Clue 1 is above or below it.

Given that we've already used some of the cells around (2,3), and considering the need to leave space between clues as well as maintain a continuous path, I deduce that Clue 2 must be located either at (1,3) or (3,3). Since the puzzle instructions don't specify how the board is laid out relative to clue locations beyond "in ascending order," we'll consider both possibilities.

However, moving to (3,3) would block potential paths and not be a direct or efficient choice for reaching subsequent clues. Thus, Clue 2's likely location seems to be at (1,3), which aligns with the puzzle progression strategy of avoiding backtracking while keeping all possible paths open.

**EVALUATION**: 
- **Move to (3,1)**: This move does not directly approach a clue but leaves room for potential future directions. It's a safe option that doesn't close off any possible path but also doesn't contribute significantly to the immediate goal of finding Clue 2.
  
- **Move to (2,0)**: Moving down would keep the path open and allow potentially easier access to further clues once we're at a central location. However, it doesn't bring us closer to Clue 2's likely position.

- **Move to (2,2)**: This move keeps us in the vicinity of our current clue sequence but does not directly approach Clue 2's likely location. It's an option that could lead to confusion if we start filling in more cells without a clear direction towards subsequent clues.

**DECISION**: Considering the goal of reaching Clue 2 at (1,3) and maintaining a continuous path while keeping options open for future movements, I will choose to move closer to the likely location of Clue 2 but also ensure that we don't box ourselves in or block potential paths.

MOVE: (3,1)

This choice allows us to keep our options open and maintain a balanced approach towards reaching Clues 2 and beyond while ensuring we don't prematurely close off any paths.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,1), which is one of the available next moves mentioned in the problem statement. The board is partially filled, and my path so far is (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). I have already visited clue 1 at position (2,3), and now it's time to visit the next clue in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number should be clue 2. However, I don't see a direct indication of its location from my current position. Since I have filled 8/16 cells, and clue 1 is already visited at (2,3), I need to figure out where clue 2 might be located.

3. EVALUATION: From my current position (3,1), the available next moves are (3,0) or (3,2). Let's evaluate each option:

   * Moving to (3,0): If I move left to (3,0), I'll create an opportunity to fill a cell between clue 1 at (2,3) and my current position. This could potentially allow me to visit the next clue in ascending order more efficiently.
   
   * Moving to (3,2): If I move right to (3,2), I might block some future paths or create an unnecessary detour.

4. DECISION: Based on the evaluation of available moves, moving left to (3,0) seems like a better option. This allows me to fill cells between clue 1 and my current position more efficiently and creates opportunities for visiting the next clues in ascending order.

Clue 2's location is unknown at this point, but I can deduce its possible locations based on the remaining empty cells.

3. EVALUATION: From position (3,0), I have two available moves to consider: moving left to (2,0) or staying put and exploring other options. The pros of moving left are that it might open up new paths for future moves or help me fill in the empty cell between Clue 1's location and my current position. However, doing so would also mean I'm temporarily leaving a potential path behind.

4. DECISION: Considering the available moves, I'll choose to move left to (2,0). This decision allows me to maintain flexibility for future moves while keeping the option of moving up or down open.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (2,0), and I have already visited clue number 5 at position (2,3). My path taken so far is a bit of a loop back to the top row. According to rule #3, I need to visit all clues in ascending order. Clue 6 has not been visited yet. Since the highest numbered clue I've seen so far is 5 and the current position is (2,0), I should aim for clue number 6.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (1,0) or (3,0). From these options:

- Moving to (1,0) would get me closer to clue #6 at a faster pace.

I am currently at position (1,0), which is in the first row and first column of the board. I have already visited the highest numbered clue on the board (clue 11 at position (3,2)), so my next goal is to visit clues 12-16 in ascending order. The current path has been filled from (2,3) to (1,0), covering a range of clues and filling some cells between them.

Looking ahead, I need to plan the most efficient route to reach all remaining clues without revisiting any cells or blocking potential paths. Since the clue locations are not specified after (2,3), I will assume that subsequent clues will be placed in descending order (higher row numbers followed by higher column numbers).

The next clue number should be 12, as we're currently at a path length of 11/16 filled. Clue 12 is likely to be positioned in the remaining rows or columns that haven't been visited yet.

Available options are:
- Move to (0,0) which seems like it could potentially lead me closer to the next clue (clue 12).

EVALUATION:

Option 1: Moving to (0,0):
Pros:
- This move places us in a starting position from where we can explore more of the board.
Cons:
- It might not get us directly close to clue 12.

DECISION:

Given the current path and available options, moving to (0,0) seems like the best choice for now as it gives me flexibility to plan my next move more effectively.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,0), and I have filled 11 out of 16 cells. The last three clue numbers I visited were 3, 7, and 8. My goal is to visit the next higher numbered clue in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is 6 (since 5 was previously skipped), but its location is not given. However, my current position is at (1,0) and the closest available move is (0,0). Since I'm stuck for now, I'll assume that Clue 6's location will be revealed once I make a valid move. Therefore, the next clue number to visit after Clue 6 would logically be the one with its position known.

3. EVALUATION:
Given my current position (1,0), I have four available moves: 
- Move up: (0,0)
- Move left is not an option since it's out of bounds.
- Moving right from (1,0) or downwards would take me away from the goal of finding a new path to Clue 6 and its subsequent clues.

Pros for moving up:
- It brings me closer to potential paths that lead to higher numbered clue positions.
- Since I've already filled most of the rows below my current position, there's a good chance that moving up will reveal a clear path.

Cons for moving up:
- There is no guarantee that I'll find a viable next step after reaching (0,0).

4. DECISION:
Considering the available moves and their potential outcomes, the best option seems to be moving up to (0,0). This move allows me to explore new possibilities in the top row, which might provide a clearer path towards finding Clue 6's location.

- Moving right from (1,0) or downwards would take me away from the goal of finding a new path to Clue 6 and its subsequent clues.

Pros for moving up:
- It brings me closer to potential paths that lead to higher numbered clue positions.
- Since I've already filled most of the rows below my current position, there's a good chance that moving up will reveal a clear path.

Cons for moving up:
- There is no guarantee that I'll find a viable next step after reaching (0,0).

4. DECISION:
Considering the available moves and their potential outcomes, the best option seems to be moving up to (0,0). This move allows me to explore new possibilities in the top row, which might provide a clearer path towards finding Clue 6's location.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (0,0), which is the top-left corner of the board. I have filled 12 out of 16 cells and visited clues 1 through 2. According to the path taken, my last visit was from (1,3) to (0,0). Looking at the current game state, I can see that there are empty cells between clue 2 and the highest numbered clue, which is still unknown.

Since the only available clue numbers left are higher than 2, the next clue number I should aim for is clue 3. However, its location is not specified in the clues list, but we can deduce it from the current path taken: it's likely that the next clue will be located either horizontally or vertically adjacent to one of the previously visited cells.

Let's examine my available moves:

* (0,1): Moving right from (0,0) gets me closer to a potential location for clue 3. It also doesn't block any future paths.
* (1,0): Moving down from (0,0) might be a good option if there was an empty cell below, but the path taken shows that I've already visited cells at position (1,0).
* (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) are not available moves as they would require revisiting a cell or moving in a non-allowed direction.

EVALUATION:

The pros of moving to (0,1) include getting closer to a potential location for clue 3 and avoiding blocked paths. The cons are that we still don't know the exact location of clue 3, so this move might not directly lead to it.

DECISION:

Considering my current situation and available moves, I will choose the move that gets me closer to a potential location for clue 3 while avoiding blocked paths.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,0) with a path of length 12 and have visited all clues up to this point in ascending order. I need to visit clue 13 next. However, there is no available move listed for me since I'm stuck! This means that we'll have to find an alternative solution.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've exhausted the list of available moves, let's re-examine my current position and path. My last visited cell was (0,0), but I can't revisit it as per rule 6. Now, looking at the grid from (0,0), I see that clue 13 is located at position (2,3). However, to visit clue 13, I need to traverse the cells between them. A viable next step could be visiting another cell in the path, allowing me to fill empty cells and get closer to clue 13.

3. EVALUATION:
Considering my current situation, here are some possible moves from (0,0):
- Moving to (1,0) would allow me to continue exploring the first row but wouldn't bring me closer to clue 13.
- Moving to (0,1) is not an option since I've already visited that cell.
- Moving diagonally or horizontally in any other direction isn't an available move according to the rules.

However, I can try to analyze my path more closely. After visiting clue 2 at position (3,1), I had moved to position (3,0) and then (2,0). If I revisit some of these cells and continue moving in a logical sequence, I may be able to get unstuck.

4. DECISION:
Considering the available moves and my current path, I will attempt to retrace some of my previous steps and move towards clue 13 more directly.

2025-11-23 20:32:30,372 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - REASONING:
2025-11-23 20:32:30,372 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,0) with a path of length 12 and have visited all clues up to this point in ascending order. I need to visit clue 13 next. However, there is no available move listed for me since I'm stuck! This means that we'll have to find an alternative solution.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've exhausted the list of available moves, let's re-examine my current position and path. My last visited cell was (0,0), but I can't revisit it as per rule 6. Now, looking at the grid from (0,0), I see that clue 13 is located at position (2,3). However, to visit clue 13, I need to traverse the cells between them. A viable next step could be visiting another cell in the path, allowing me to fill empty cells and get closer to clue 13.

3. EVALUATION:
Considering my current situation, here are some possible moves from (0,0):
- Moving to (1,0) would allow me to continue exploring the first row but wouldn't bring me closer to clue 13.
- Moving to (0,1) is not an option since I've already visited that cell.
- Moving diagonally or horizontally in any other direction isn't an available move according to the rules.

However, I can try to analyze my path more closely. After visiting clue 2 at position (3,1), I had moved to position (3,0) and then (2,0). If I revisit some of these cells and continue moving in a logical sequence, I may be able to get unstuck.

4. DECISION:
Considering the available moves and my current path, I will attempt to retrace some of my previous steps and move towards clue 13 more directly.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-11-23 20:57:37,918 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

**1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:**
- I am at position (3,2) which is clue 1 (starting position)
- I have filled 1/16 cells
- I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (3,3)
- Available moves: (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)

**2. STRATEGY - Next Objective:**
- My immediate goal is to reach clue 2 at position (3,3)
- After visiting clue 2, I need to fill the remaining 14 cells
- Since clue 2 is the last numbered clue, after reaching it, I need to ensure I can visit all remaining cells

**3. EVALUATION - Move Analysis:**

*Option A: Move to (3,3)*
- PROS: This directly reaches clue 2, fulfilling the immediate requirement
- CONS: Position (3,3) is a corner cell with only 2 possible connections. If I go there now (as my 2nd cell), I would need to continue from there and fill all remaining 14 cells. This severely limits my path options since I'd be starting from a corner.

*Option B: Move to (3,1)*
- PROS: Keeps me on the bottom row, allows flexibility
- CONS: Moves away from clue 2. I'd need to eventually come back to reach (3,3), which could create path complications

*Option C: Move to (2,2)*
- PROS: Moves upward, giving me more space to maneuver before reaching clue 2
- CONS: Also moves away from the immediate goal of clue 2

**4. DECISION:**

Wait - I need to reconsider. The rule states I must visit clues in ascending order, but I can fill empty cells between them. Since clue 2 at (3,3) is the LAST clue and also the END point of my path, I should NOT go there immediately. I need to fill the other 14 cells first, then end at (3,3).

Given this understanding:
- Moving to (3,3) now would be a mistake - I'd be trapped in a corner with 14 cells still to fill
- Moving to (3,1) or (2,2) allows me to build a path that eventually leads back to (3,3)

Between (3,1) and (2,2):
- (3,1) keeps me on the bottom row but limits upward expansion
- (2,2) moves me into the center of the board, providing maximum flexibility for creating a path that covers all cells and eventually returns to (3,3)

The best strategy is to move to (2,2), which gives me central positioning to snake through the entire board and end at corner position (3,3).

2025-11-23 20:57:54,075 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,2) and have filled 2 out of 16 cells. My path so far has been: (3,2) [clue 1] -> (2,2). I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,3).

2. STRATEGY:
My immediate goal is to reach clue 2 at position (3,3). However, I must be strategic about HOW I get there because I need to visit ALL 16 cells in one continuous path. Since clue 2 is the final clue, after reaching it, I won't have any more mandatory destinations - but I still need to ensure I can visit all remaining cells.

3. EVALUATION of available moves:

Option A: (1,2) - Move UP
- This takes me away from clue 2 (which is down and to the right)
- Opens up the upper portion of the board
- Could allow me to snake through the top rows before coming back down
- Pros: Gives me access to fill the top half of the board systematically
- Cons: Delays reaching clue 2

Option B: (2,1) - Move LEFT
- This takes me away from clue 2 (which is to the right and down)
- Opens up the left side of the board
- Pros: Could allow a systematic left-to-right sweep
- Cons: Takes me further from clue 2

Option C: (2,3) - Move RIGHT
- This moves me closer to clue 2 horizontally
- From (2,3), I could move down to (3,3) to reach clue 2
- Cons: If I go directly to clue 2, I'll only have filled 4 cells out of 16, leaving 12 cells unreachable after ending at clue 2
- This would be a TRAP - I cannot reach clue 2 too early!

4. DECISION:
Moving to (2,3) and then directly to clue 2 would be disastrous - I'd end the puzzle having only visited 4 cells out of 16. I need to explore the rest of the board FIRST before reaching clue 2.

The best strategy is to move to (1,2), which allows me to systematically fill the upper portion of the board. I can snake through rows 0 and 1, then come back down through the left side, and finally approach clue 2 at (3,3) after having visited all other cells.

2025-11-23 20:57:54,084 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,2) and have filled 2 out of 16 cells. My path so far has been: (3,2) [clue 1] -> (2,2). I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,3).

2. STRATEGY:
My immediate goal is to reach clue 2 at position (3,3). However, I must be strategic about HOW I get there because I need to visit ALL 16 cells in one continuous path. Since clue 2 is the final clue, after reaching it, I won't have any more mandatory destinations - but I still need to ensure I can visit all remaining cells.

3. EVALUATION of available moves:

Option A: (1,2) - Move UP
- This takes me away from clue 2 (which is down and to the right)
- Opens up the upper portion of the board
- Could allow me to snake through the top rows before coming back down
- Pros: Gives me access to fill the top half of the board systematically
- Cons: Delays reaching clue 2

Option B: (2,1) - Move LEFT
- This takes me away from clue 2 (which is to the right and down)
- Opens up the left side of the board
- Pros: Could allow a systematic left-to-right sweep
- Cons: Takes me further from clue 2

Option C: (2,3) - Move RIGHT
- This moves me closer to clue 2 horizontally
- From (2,3), I could move down to (3,3) to reach clue 2
- Cons: If I go directly to clue 2, I'll only have filled 4 cells out of 16, leaving 12 cells unreachable after ending at clue 2

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-11-23 20:58:09,798 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 16 cells. My path so far has been: (3,2) [clue 1] -> (2,2) -> (1,2) [current position]. I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,3).

2. STRATEGY:
My next mandatory target is clue 2 at position (3,3). I need to create a path from my current position (1,2) to (3,3) while ensuring I can still visit all remaining cells (13 more cells to fill after this move).

3. EVALUATION:

Option A: Move to (0,2)
- This moves me UP and AWAY from clue 2 at (3,3)
- From (0,2), I would be at the top of the board
- This could be useful for filling the top row, but I'd need to eventually work my way back down to (3,3)
- Distance to clue 2: Would need to go down 3 rows and right 1 column

Option B: Move to (1,1)
- This moves me LEFT and AWAY from clue 2 at (3,3)
- From (1,1), I'd be moving away from my target
- Distance to clue 2: Would need complex maneuvering to reach (3,3)

Option C: Move to (1,3)
- This moves me RIGHT, getting closer to clue 2's column
- From (1,3), I'm in the same column as clue 2
- I can then move down through (2,3) to reach (3,3)
- This creates a direct path: (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3)
- After reaching clue 2, I'll have visited 6 cells and need to fill 10 more
- The remaining cells would form a connected region that I can traverse

4. DECISION:
Move (1,3) is the best choice because:
- It positions me in the same column as clue 2, creating a clear path to my next mandatory target
- It allows for a simple route: current -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) to reach clue 2
- After reaching clue 2 at (3,3), I'll be at the bottom-right corner with 10 cells remaining to fill, which forms a manageable connected region
- This move doesn't create any isolated cells or dead ends that would prevent completing the puzzle

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-11-23 20:58:37,157 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (0,3) in the top-right corner of the board. I have filled 5 out of 16 cells so far. My path has been: (3,2) → (2,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (0,3). I started at clue 1 at position (3,2) and need to reach clue 2 at position (3,3). However, I notice that I haven't actually visited clue 2 yet, even though my path went from (3,2) to (2,2), which means I moved away from clue 2.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (3,3). This is critical - I must visit all clues in order. Currently, I'm at (0,3) and clue 2 is at (3,3), which is directly below me in the same column, 3 rows down.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
My only available move is (0,2), moving left from (0,3).

Pros of moving to (0,2):
- It's the only legal move available
- It keeps me in the top row, allowing me to continue building a path
- I can potentially work my way around the board to eventually reach clue 2 at (3,3)

Cons of moving to (0,2):
- It moves me further away from clue 2 horizontally
- I need to be very careful about path planning to ensure I can still reach (3,3) and fill all 16 cells

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
Since (0,2) is my only available move, I must take it. The key consideration is whether this move allows me to complete the puzzle. From (0,2), I can continue left to (0,1) and (0,0), then work my way down the left side of the board, eventually reaching the bottom row where I can move right to reach clue 2 at (3,3). This path should allow me to visit all 16 cells and end at clue 2.

2025-11-23 20:58:58,174 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled 6 out of 16 cells. My path so far has been:
- Started at clue 1 at (3,2)
- Moved up through column 2: (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2)
- Then moved right to (1,3)
- Moved up to (0,3)
- Now at (0,2)

I've already visited clue 1 at (3,2) and clue 2 at (3,3). Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I need to eventually end my path there. However, I've already passed through (3,3) as my 4th step, which means I need to reconsider...

Wait, let me recheck the path. Looking at the visual board:
- [1] is at (3,2) - clue 1 ✓
- [4] is at (1,3) 
- [5] is at (0,3)
- [6] is at (0,2) - current position

The clue 2 is at position (3,3), but I don't see it marked in my path yet. Looking at the board legend, position (3,3) shows "2" (a clue), not [2] (visited). This means I haven't visited clue 2 yet!

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (3,3). I have 10 more cells to fill (16 total - 6 filled = 10 remaining). I need to create a path from (0,2) that eventually reaches (3,3) while visiting all remaining cells exactly once.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
My only available move is (0,1).

Moving to (0,1):
- PROS: This continues filling the top row from right to left, which is a systematic approach. It keeps my options open for creating a path that can snake through the remaining cells.
- CONS: I need to ensure I can still reach (3,3) after filling all remaining cells.

Let me trace a potential complete path:
(0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1)... wait, that revisits (2,1).

Let me try: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,3)... but that skips (2,3).

Actually: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)... revisits again.

Better path: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,3) - can't jump to (2,3).

Let me think differently: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,3) - can't reach (2,3) from (1,1).

Valid path: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> ... but then I'm stuck at (0,0) with (2,3) and (3,3) unreachable.

I've already visited clue 1 at (3,2) and clue 2 at (3,3). Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I need to eventually end at (3,3). However, I've already passed through (3,3) as my 4th step in the path, which means I've already visited it.

Wait, let me recheck the path: Looking at the visual board, position (3,3) shows "2" which is the clue location, not a filled path cell. My path shows [4] at (1,3), which is adjacent to where clue 2 should be.

Actually, reviewing more carefully: The path goes (3,2)[1] -> (2,2)[2] -> (1,2)[3] -> (1,3)[4] -> (0,3)[5] -> (0,2)[6]. Position (3,3) still shows "2" as an unfilled clue, meaning I haven't visited clue 2 yet!

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
I need to visit clue 2 at position (3,3). Since I must visit all clues in order and end at the highest clue, I need to eventually reach (3,3) and make it my final destination (cell 16).

3. EVALUATION: For each available move
My only available move is (0,1). Let me evaluate:
- Moving to (0,1): This continues my path along the top row moving left. I have 10 more cells to fill before reaching (3,3) as my final cell. From (0,1), I can continue building a path that eventually reaches (3,3).

Since there's only one available move, I must take it. The key is ensuring this move doesn't trap me or prevent me from visiting all remaining cells and ending at (3,3).

4. DECISION:
I must move to (0,1) as it's my only option. From there, I'll need to carefully plan to fill all remaining cells (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3) and ensure (3,3) is the last cell visited.

From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 7 out of 16 cells. My path so far has been: (3,2) [clue 1] -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1).

I've already visited clue 1 at (3,2) and need to visit clue 2 at (3,3) next. However, looking at my path, I already passed through (1,3) which is adjacent to (3,3), but I went upward instead of toward the clue.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
I need to visit clue 2 at position (3,3). This is my ultimate destination since it's the highest numbered clue and must be the end of my path.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Available moves from (0,1): (1,1) and (0,0)

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This moves me toward the center of the board
- From (1,1), I could access (1,0) and (2,1)
- This would allow me to explore the left side of the board
- I still have 9 cells left to fill before reaching (3,3)
- Path would be: (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (0,0) -> ... but wait, I need to check if this works

Option B: Move to (0,0)
- This moves me to the corner
- From (0,0), I would only be able to move to (1,0) next
- This seems more restrictive but might be necessary to fill all cells

Let me trace out possible complete paths:

If I go (1,1): (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> ... but then I'm stuck because I can't reach (0,0) without revisiting cells.

If I go (0,0): (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> ... but then where? I'd need to get to (3,3) eventually.

Let me reconsider: I have 9 empty cells left: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3).

The path must end at (3,3). Working backwards, to reach (3,3), I must come from either (2,3) or (3,2), but (3,2) is already visited. So I MUST approach (3,3) from (2,3).

To reach (2,3), I must come from (2,2) (already visited) or (1,3) (already visited) or (3,3) (destination). This is impossible! 

Wait, let me recheck: (2,3) can be reached from (2,2) [visited], (1,3) [visited], or (3,3) [destination]. All are unavailable, so (2,3) must have already been in my path or... let me recount.

Actually, looking at the visual board, (2,3) shows as "." (empty), so it hasn't been visited yet. So the path to (3,3) must go through (2,3).

The only way to reach (2,3) now is if I haven't visited it yet. From (2,3), I can reach (3,3).

So my path needs to eventually reach (2,3) and then (3,3).

Given my current position at (0,1), I need to fill: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,

2025-11-23 20:59:53,934 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 7 out of 16 cells. My path so far has been: (3,2) [clue 1] -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1).

I've already visited clue 1 at (3,2) and need to visit clue 2 at (3,3) next. However, looking at my path, I notice I've already passed through (1,3) which is adjacent to (3,3), but I didn't go to clue 2 then. This means I need to find a way back to (3,3).

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
I need to visit clue 2 at position (3,3). Since I've already filled 7 cells and need to fill all 16 cells, I have 9 more cells to fill before ending at (3,3).

Let me count the remaining empty cells:
- Row 0: (0,0) - 1 cell
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1) - 2 cells  
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,3) - 3 cells
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,3) - 3 cells
Total: 9 empty cells remaining

I need to visit all 9 remaining cells and end at (3,3).

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This keeps me in the middle area of the board
- From (1,1), I can access (1,0), (2,1), which opens up the left side
- This allows me to snake through the remaining cells systematically

Option B: Move to (0,0)
- This takes me to a corner
- From (0,0), I can only move to (1,0), which is very limiting
- This could trap me early and make it impossible to visit all cells

Let me trace a potential path from (1,1):
(0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) ✓
This works! It visits all 9 remaining cells and ends at clue 2.

Let me check from (0,0):
(0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> ... I'd need to get to (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (2,3), (3,3)
This seems more convoluted and risky.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
Move to (1,1) is clearly the better choice. It allows me to systematically visit the left side of the board, work my way down, then across the bottom, and finally reach clue 2 at (3,3). Moving to (0,0) would corner me unnecessarily and make path planning much more difficult.

2025-11-23 20:59:53,942 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - REASONING:
2025-11-23 20:59:53,942 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 7 out of 16 cells. My path so far has been: (3,2) [clue 1] -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1).

I've already visited clue 1 at (3,2) and need to visit clue 2 at (3,3) next. However, looking at my path, I notice I've already passed through (1,3) which is adjacent to (3,3), but I didn't go to clue 2 then. This means I need to find a way back to (3,3).

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
I need to visit clue 2 at position (3,3). Since I've already filled 7 cells and need to fill all 16 cells, I have 9 more cells to fill before ending at (3,3).

Let me count the remaining empty cells:
- Row 0: (0,0) - 1 cell
- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1) - 2 cells  
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,3) - 3 cells
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,3) - 3 cells
Total: 9 empty cells remaining

I need to visit all 9 remaining cells and end at (3,3).

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This keeps me in the middle area of the board
- From (1,1), I can access (1,0), (2,1), which opens up the left side
- This allows me to snake through the remaining cells systematically

Option B: Move to (0,0)
- This takes me to a corner
- From (0,0), I can only move to (1,0), which is very limiting
- This could trap me early and make it impossible to visit all cells

Let me trace a potential path from (1,1):
(0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) ✓
This works! It visits all 9 remaining cells and ends at clue 2.

Let me check from (0,0):
(0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> ... I'd need to get to (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (2,3), (3,3)
This seems more convoluted and risky.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
Move to (1,1) is clearly the better choice. It allows me to systematically visit the left side of the board, work my way down, then across the bottom, and finally reach clue 2 at (3,3). Moving to (0,0) would corner me unnecessarily and make path planning much more difficult.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 8 out of 16 cells. I started at clue 1 at (3,2) and have already visited clue 2 at (3,3). Since I've visited both clues (1 and 2), I now need to complete the path by visiting all remaining 8 empty cells without revisiting any cell.

Current path: (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1)

Remaining empty cells to visit: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3) - wait, let me recount.

Looking at the board:
- Row 0: (0,0) is empty, rest are filled
- Row 1: (1,0) is empty, (1,1) is current position (filled), rest are filled
- Row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,3) are empty, (2,2) is filled
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,1) are empty, (3,2) and (3,3) are filled

Empty cells: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1) = 7 cells
Plus current position = 8 filled, so 8 more to go.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
I've already visited both clues (1 and 2), so now I just need to complete a Hamiltonian path through all remaining cells.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Option A: Move to (2,1)
- This moves down into the middle-left area
- From (2,1), I could access (2,0), (3,1), or (2,2) [already visited]
- This would allow me to sweep through the bottom-left area
- Path could continue: (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> then need to get to (2,3) and (0,0)
- From (3,1), I'd need to reach (2,3) - would go (3,1) -> (2,1) [already visited] - BLOCKED!
- This creates a problem - the bottom area would be isolated from (2,3) and (0,0)

Option B: Move to (1,0)
- This moves left along row 1
- From (1,0), I can access (0,0) or (2,0)
- Path could continue: (1,0) -> (0,0) -> done with top-left
- Then from (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3)
- Wait, let me trace: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) [dead end, must backtrack via (1,0)]
- Actually: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3) [need to check if reachable]
- But I also need (0,0). From (1,0) I could go to (0,0) first, but then (0,0) is a dead end.
- Better: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) [dead end] - doesn't work
- Or: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3) -> then need (0,0) - can't reach!

Let me reconsider: I need to visit (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 8 out of 16 cells. Looking at my path, I started at clue 1 at (3,2) and have already visited clue 2 at (3,3). Since there are only 2 clues and I've visited both in order, I now need to fill the remaining 8 empty cells to complete the puzzle.

Current empty cells: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), and I need to visit all of them.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all clues (1 and 2), my goal is to create a path that visits all remaining empty cells exactly once without getting trapped. I need to be careful not to create a situation where I isolate cells that become unreachable.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (1,1):
- (2,1): This moves down to row 2. From (2,1), I could access (2,0) and (3,1). This seems promising as it keeps options open.
- (1,0): This moves left to the corner. From (1,0), I would only be able to move to (2,0), which could potentially trap me early since corner positions have limited connectivity.

Let me trace potential paths:

Option A - Move to (2,1):
Path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1)... wait, (2,1) is already visited. Let me reconsider.
Path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> ... but then I'm stuck at (1,0) with (2,3) still unvisited and unreachable.

Actually, let me reconsider the remaining cells: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1) - that's 6 cells, plus my current position makes 7, but I need 8 more to reach 16 total. So 8 more moves needed.

Option B - Move to (1,0):
Path: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3) - but (2,3) is isolated from (2,1).

Let me reconsider: From (2,1), I can reach (2,0), (3,1), or (2,2) - but (2,2) is already visited.

The key insight: (2,3) is currently isolated and can only be reached from (1,3) or (3,3), both of which are already visited. This means (2,3) is now UNREACHABLE! 

Wait, let me recheck the board... (2,3) can be reached from (1,3) which is visited, or (3,3) which is visited, or (2,2) which is visited. So (2,3) is indeed unreachable now.

Actually, this means the puzzle might already be in an unsolvable state, OR (2,3) was already visited and I miscounted. Let me recount the path: 8 cells filled, and there are 8 remaining to fill to reach 16.

4. DECISION:
Given the constraint, I should move to (2,1) as it provides better access to the cluster of unvisited cells in the bottom-left area (3,0), (3,1), (2,0), (1,0), allowing for a longer continuous path before potentially getting stuck.

Path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> ... but then I'm stuck at (1,0) with (2,3) still unvisited and unreachable.

Actually, let me reconsider the remaining cells: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1) - that's 6 cells, plus my current position makes 7, but I need 8 more to reach 16 total. So 8 more moves needed.

Option B - Move to (1,0):
Path: (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,3) - but (2,3) is isolated from (2,1).

Let me reconsider: From (2,1), I can reach (2,0), (3,1), or (2,2) - but (2,2) is already visited.

The key insight: (2,3) is currently isolated and can only be reached from (1,3) or (3,3), both of which are already visited. This means (2,3) is now UNREACHABLE! 

Wait, let me recheck the board... (2,3) can be reached from (1,3) which is visited, or (3,3) which is visited, or (2,2) which is visited. So (2,3) is indeed unreachable now.

Actually, this means the puzzle might already be in an unsolvable state, OR (2,3) was already visited and I miscounted. Let me recount the path: 8 cells filled, and there are 8 remaining to fill to reach 16.

4. DECISION:
Given the constraint, I should move to (2,1) as it provides better access to the cluster of unvisited cells in the bottom-left area (3,0), (3,1), (2,0), (1,0), allowing for a longer continuous path before potentially getting stuck.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-11-23 21:00:57,906 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 9 out of 16 cells. I started at clue 1 at (3,2) and have already visited clue 2 at (3,3). Since I've visited both clues (1 and 2), my remaining task is to fill all the remaining 7 empty cells to complete the 16-cell path.

Looking at the board:
- Empty cells remaining: (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3) - wait, let me recount
- Actually, the empty cells are: (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,3) is clue 2 which I already visited as step [4]
- Let me trace: positions with dots (.) are: (1,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1)
- That's 4 empty cells, plus my current position makes 9 filled, so 16 - 9 = 7 cells remaining to fill

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all clues (1 and 2), I just need to complete the path by visiting all remaining empty cells. I need to ensure I don't trap myself and can reach all remaining cells.

Remaining empty cells to visit: (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), and I need to count correctly - let me look at the visual again.

From the visual, cells marked with [#] are filled (9 cells), cells with numbers are clues. Empty cells (.) are at:
- Row 1: (1,0)
- Row 2: (2,3)
- Row 3: (3,0), (3,1)

That's 4 empty cells + current position + 2 more = 7 remaining cells to fill.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves: (3,1) or (2,0)

Option A: Move to (3,1)
- This takes me to the bottom row
- From (3,1), I could reach (3,0) or back to (3,2) [already visited]
- If I go (3,1) -> (3,0), I'd be in the corner
- From (3,0), I can only go to (2,0)
- From (2,0), I can go to (1,0) or back to (3,0) [visited]
- From (1,0), I can go to (2,0) [visited] - this creates a dead end!
- Wait, from (1,0) I could also go to (0,0) but that's already filled [7]
- This path would be: (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) - that's only 4 more cells, but I still need to reach (2,3)
- From (1,0), I cannot reach (2,3) without revisiting cells. This doesn't work!

Option B: Move to (2,0)
- From (2,0), I can reach (1,0) or (3,0)
- If I go (2,0) -> (1,0), then from (1,0) I'm stuck (can't reach other empty cells)
- If I go (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1), then I need to get back up to reach (2,3) and (1,0)
- From (3,1), I can go to (2,1) [visited] - dead end!

Let me reconsider: I need to reach (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1) and 2 more cells.

Actually, looking more carefully: I need to fill 7 more cells total. The path must visit: (2,0), (1,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), and 2 others.

The best strategy is: (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

If I move to (2,3), it may also limit my future paths.

I will move to (3,2) to explore the lower portion of the board.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-11-25 18:16:56,655 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,2) and have filled 10 cells. There are no more numbered clues left, so the goal is to visit all remaining empty cells (15 of them) and ensure the path ends at the highest number, which in this case will be position 25.
Available moves are (4,2), (3,1), and (3,3).
Moving to (4,2) seems reasonable. It opens up the bottom row and doesn't immediately block anything.
Moving to (3,1) might be risky because it could potentially isolate the cells (3,0) and (4,0), making them unreachable without revisiting a cell.
Moving to (3,3) also seems acceptable. It gives access to the (3,4) and (2,3) cells.

Let's consider the long-term consequences of each move.
If I go to (4,2), then I could go to (4,1), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), and then I am stuck unless I go back to (3,0). So it will create a dead end.
If I go to (3,3), I could then go to (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), which seems like a reasonable path.
If I go to (3,1), it feels restrictive.

Therefore, the best move is (3,3).

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,4) and have filled 13 cells. There are 25 cells in total. The next clue to visit is clue number 3. I have already visited clue 3. There is no clue to visit after clue number 2. Therefore I must continue the path until I have visited every cell exactly once, and then the puzzle is solved.

The available next moves are (1,4) and (2,3).

If I move to (1,4), I would be at (1,4). This seems reasonable because the path needs to fill out the upper right corner and avoid cutting off the lower part of the board.
If I move to (2,3), I would be at (2,3). This might cut off a large portion of the board if I am not careful.
Therefore, I should prioritize (1,4) as it seems more natural.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-11-25 18:17:26,330 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 16 cells. I need to find a way to visit all 25 cells. I am stuck because all adjacent cells (0,2), (1,1), (2,2), (1,3) are already occupied. This means my current path is not a valid solution. I need to backtrack and find a different path earlier in the sequence. Let's go back to the start and rethink.

The initial moves are dictated by clues 1 and 2. The path (0,4) -> (0,3) is mandatory. After that, I chose (0,2). However, a different choice is to go from (0,3) to (1,3). Let's explore that possibility.

Let's reset and try a different path after visiting clue 2 at (0,3). The goal is to visit (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).

THINKING:
Since I'm stuck at position (1,2) with no valid moves forward, it indicates a problem with the earlier path. Let's retrace the steps and see where a mistake could have been made.

Current Path: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2)

After visiting (0,3), the move to (0,2) might have been a mistake. Let's try a different approach from (0,3).
From (0,3), go to (1,3). From (1,3), I can go to (1,4), (2,3), (1,2), or (0,3). Since I can't revisit cells, the only viable move is (1,4).

Let's try starting over with the revised path:
(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)
Now, from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (0,2). But (2,2) is already visited, so go to (0,2) -> ...

This revised start seems more promising. Let's stick to the current state and see if we can fix it.

Given the current state and the fact that I am stuck, the only solution is to restart the puzzle and find a different path from the beginning.

MOVE: None (Restart)

2025-11-25 18:17:26,336 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 16 cells. I need to find a way to visit all 25 cells. I am stuck because all adjacent cells (0,2), (1,1), (2,2), (1,3) are already occupied. This means my current path is not a valid solution. I need to backtrack and find a different path earlier in the sequence. Let's go back to the start and rethink.

The initial moves are dictated by clues 1 and 2. The path (0,4) -> (0,3) is mandatory. After that, I chose (0,2). However, a different choice is to go from (0,3) to (1,3). Let's explore that possibility.

Let's reset and try a different path after visiting clue 2 at (0,3). The goal is to visit (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).

THINKING:
Since I'm stuck at position (1,2) with no valid moves forward, it indicates a problem with the earlier path. Let's retrace the steps and see where a mistake could have been made.

Current Path: (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2)

After visiting (0,3), the move to (0,2) might have been a mistake. Let's try a different approach from (0,3).
From (0,3), go to (1,3). From (1,3), I can go to (1,4), (2,3), (1,2), or (0,3). Since I can't revisit cells, the only viable move is (1,4).

Let's try starting over with the revised path:
(0,4) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)
Now, from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (0,2). But (2,2) is already visited, so go to (0,2) -> ...

This revised start seems more promising. Let's stick to the current state and see if we can fix it.

Given the current state and the fact that I am stuck, the only solution is to restart the puzzle and find a different path from the beginning.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 11:36:07,360 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,3), which is Clue 1's location. I have filled 1 out of 25 cells in my path so far. The board state shows the current progress and available moves.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue to visit is Clue 2, located at position (3,3). Since we can only move horizontally or vertically, it makes sense to get as close to Clue 2's row (3) as possible while also considering how to navigate around the board efficiently.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:

* (0,3): This move would take me two rows down and keep the same column as my current position. It does not bring me closer to Clue 2 in terms of row number but does allow me to potentially find a path forward. However, it's one of our farther moves from the goal, which might limit future options.
  
* (2,3): This move would take me two rows up and keep the same column as my current position. It doesn't bring us closer to Clue 2 but keeps us on the right path for horizontal movement.

* (1,2): This move takes me one row down and one column left from my current position. It does not directly contribute to reaching Clue 2 in terms of row number but allows for some lateral movement that could be beneficial later.

* (1,4): This move would take us one column right from our current position. It doesn't bring us closer to Clue 2 and might limit future options by taking us further away from the goal's row.

4. DECISION:
Based on my analysis, moving down two rows to (2,3) or staying in the same row but moving left to (1,2) could be viable options since they allow for further movement without directly contributing to getting closer to Clue 2. However, considering we need to visit all clues in ascending order and fill empty cells between them as needed, moving up towards Clue 2's row (3) might offer more flexibility in our path forward.

Given these considerations, the best move seems to be (2,3), which allows for some initial exploration without immediately committing to a specific direction that isn't entirely clear yet. It keeps us within one row of both the starting point and Clue 2's location.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled only 1 out of 25 cells. I need to visit all clues in ascending order, starting with Clue 1. My current situation is that I'm already at the first clue, so my next move should bring me closer to Clue 2.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed Clue 2. According to the board layout, Clue 2's position is not explicitly given in this step, but we know that it must be located at (1,1) based on the ascending order requirement and my current location. We need to fill in the blank cells between clues as needed.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move, let's evaluate the pros and cons:

* Move to (1,0): This would bring me down one row from my current position but doesn't directly contribute to reaching Clue 2 or filling adjacent empty cells.
* Move to (3,0): Moving two rows up might seem like a good option, but it doesn't get me closer to Clue 2, and we're not sure if there are any other clues or obstacles in that direction yet. It's also a longer move compared to the other options.
* Move to (2,1): This move is horizontal from my current position, which aligns with visiting the next clue number, but it might be blocked by another clue or obstacle. However, given the layout and requirements of this puzzle, I believe we are not yet constrained by additional clues at this step.

4. DECISION:
Considering all factors above, I will choose to move horizontally (2,1) as my first move in the path-finding process.

2025-12-10 11:36:24,359 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0), which is the starting point with Clue 1. The goal is to visit every cell exactly once in a continuous path. The next clue to visit is Clue 2, located at position (2,4). From my current position, I have two available moves: (1,0) or (0,1).

STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit is indeed Clue 2. It's essential to get as close to it as possible while maintaining a continuous path.

EVALUATION:

- Available Move 1: (1,0)
  * Pros: Moving down will allow me to explore the rest of the top row and prepare for getting closer to Clue 2.
  * Cons: It might not bring me directly towards Clue 2 or help in forming a more efficient path.

- Available Move 2: (0,1)
  * Pros: Moving right will place me on the same row as Clue 3 but does not move me closer to Clue 2. It's crucial for completing the initial part of the path and exploring other areas.
  * Cons: It doesn't directly contribute to moving towards Clue 2.

DECISION:
The best next move is (0,1). This choice allows me to advance horizontally on the starting row, setting up for future moves that will eventually bring me closer to Clue 2 while ensuring a continuous path. Moving right also gives me more flexibility in planning subsequent steps and doesn't immediately block potential paths towards other clues.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled only 1 cell out of 25. The goal is to visit all clues in ascending order. Clue 1 is already marked, so I need to move on to clue 2 next.

Looking at the available moves: (1,2), (0,1), or (0,3).

- Moving to (1,2) would put me two spaces away from any possible direction towards clue 2. It doesn't seem like a strategic choice since it doesn't bring me closer to the next clue.
  
- Moving to (0,1) places me one row down and adjacent to clue 2, making future moves more efficient by potentially allowing me to move diagonally (though not diagonal in the traditional sense but moving right or left).

- Moving to (0,3) doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 either; it's somewhat central to my current position.

Considering the goal of visiting all clues and the efficiency of future moves, I should aim for a path that minimizes unnecessary movement and keeps options open.

I am currently at position (0,0), which is the starting point of the puzzle. I have filled only 1 out of 25 cells, and my path consists solely of clue number 1. The goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, from 1 to the highest number.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (3,0). It's directly below the starting point (0,0), so my priority should be to move there first.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (1,0) would take me diagonally down and to the right. This move breaks the puzzle rule of only moving horizontally or vertically.
* Moving to (0,1) would allow me to move one cell to the right, but it doesn't get me any closer to Clue 2.

DECISION:
Since I need to visit Clue 2 next, and it's directly below my current position, moving to (0,1) is the best choice. It sets me up for a straightforward path to Clue 2 without breaking any puzzle rules.

2025-12-10 11:36:45,062 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,4) and have filled only 1 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers. I'm starting from Clue 1 located at (4,4). Since the current position is already Clue 1, my next step should be to move towards Clue 2.

STRATEGY:
Clue number 2 needs to be visited next. However, its location isn't directly provided in the information given. To find it, I need to look for a cell that could logically follow (4,4) while moving horizontally or vertically only. 

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (3,4) or (4,3). Let's analyze each:

Pros of moving to (3,4):
- This move is horizontal from my current position, which doesn't block any future paths.
- It keeps me in a similar column as clue 1 but allows movement towards potential positions for Clue 2.

Cons of moving to (3,4):
- I'm not getting closer to the top-left corner where clues are more densely packed.
- Without additional information, it's hard to confirm if this move sets up future paths well.

Pros of moving to (4,3):
- This move is vertical from my current position and keeps me on the right side of the board. 
- It allows me to potentially move towards Clue 2 if its next location requires a downward move.
- Staying in the column means I maintain flexibility for future moves.

Cons of moving to (4,3):
- Without confirmation that this is where Clue 2 or other clues will be located, it's speculative.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 11:36:54,467 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled only 1 out of 25 cells in a single path. My current situation shows that I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, starting from clue 1.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number I should visit is clue 2, which is located at position (3,1).

3. EVALUATION:

    * **Available Move: (0,1)**:
        Pros: This move gets me closer to clue 2.
        Cons: It doesn't necessarily take me directly towards the next clue in ascending order if I consider moving back and forth without a clear path.

    * **Available Move: (0,3)**:
        Pros: This move also gets me slightly closer to clue 2 but considering I have to move vertically or horizontally, it might not be the most efficient choice.
        Cons: Similar to the previous point, this doesn't directly contribute towards visiting clues in ascending order.

    * **Available Move: (1,2)**:
        Pros: This move keeps me on a potential path that could eventually lead to clue 2 if I continue moving down and then left. It also maintains the ascending order requirement by not jumping back to previous clues.
        Cons: While it doesn't block any immediate future paths, there might be more direct routes or better efficiency in visiting clues in ascending order.

4. DECISION:
Considering the need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order efficiently and given my current position, moving down (1,2) seems like the most straightforward choice that maintains a potential path towards clue 2 while adhering to the rule of ascending order.

MOVE: (1,0)

Note: The chosen move is (1,0), not (1,2) as mentioned in the evaluation. This change ensures we're moving closer to clue 2 and maintaining an efficient path while following the rules.

(0,1): Moving left is not an option because it would take me away from my current position and not closer to the next clue.
(2,1): Moving straight down to (2,1) directly to the next clue without any empty cell in between. This move would fill one of the required cells in ascending order but does not allow for a path through other clues yet.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 11:42:45,325 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (4,0), and my current situation is that I have filled only 1 out of 25 cells. The starting point, clue number 1, is already visited.

**STRATEGY:** My next goal is to visit the second clue, which is located at position (3,1). To get there efficiently, I need to plan a path from my current position to this location while considering the constraints of the puzzle.

**EVALUATION:**

- **Move 1: (3,0)**: This move would bring me closer to the desired clue (2), but it does not contribute directly towards reaching the second clue in an optimal manner. It might limit future options slightly by moving away from the right-hand side of the board where higher clues are located.

- **Move 2: (4,1)**: Moving diagonally up and right would bring me into position to potentially visit other clues more efficiently but does not directly address the necessity of visiting clue number 2 first. It might create a somewhat inefficient path if I need to backtrack later on.

**DECISION:** Considering the goal is to reach clue number 2 at (3,1) in an efficient manner while also respecting the puzzle's constraints, moving diagonally up one space to **(4,1)** initially seems like a reasonable choice. This move prepares me for reaching higher clues and does not immediately block any paths that might be needed later on.

I am currently at position (4,1), having just visited clue 2 located at (3,1). I have filled 2 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit all clues in ascending order. The next clue I need to visit is clue 3. However, there are no clue locations given for the board, so we must assume that the clue numbers already filled on the board indicate their respective positions.

Looking at the visual board state, I see that clue 1 (at position (4,0)) has been visited and clue 2 (at position (3,1)) is also marked. The next available clue number is 3, but it's not yet marked on the board. My goal now is to reach clue 3.

STRATEGY:
To find clue 3, I need to visit the cell that will be marked as "3" in the visual board state. Since there are no other clues mentioned, we can deduce that any empty cells between visited clues should be filled by moving horizontally or vertically.

EVALUATION:

Available Next Moves: (3,1), (4,2)

For each available move:
- Moving to (3,1) seems counterintuitive since I've just come from there and visited clue 2. This move doesn't seem to advance me towards finding clue 3 or furthering my path.
- Moving to (4,2) gets me closer to reaching the area where we can mark a new clue number on the board without revisiting any previously marked cells.

DECISION:
Considering the goal of moving towards unvisited areas and marking new clues in ascending order, I should choose the move that brings me closer to an empty cell. Therefore:

2025-12-10 11:43:10,500 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (4,2), and I have filled 3 out of 25 cells in my path so far. The current state of the board shows that I've visited clue numbers 1, 2, and 3 in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I need to visit all 5 clues, I should aim to find the next one on the list, which is Clue #4. Unfortunately, its location isn't provided, but I can try to deduce it or look for a lead to get closer to it. However, given the available information and current board state, my primary goal should be to move towards Clue #3, as we have not explicitly moved past it yet.

However, upon reviewing the clue numbers already visited, we realize that Clue #4's location isn't directly relevant at this moment since we're focusing on where to go next after visiting Clue #3. We actually need to think about moving towards our next visit in order which is indeed Clue #4 but given the available information and current state of the board, my primary goal should be to figure out how to get closer or position ourselves for future moves towards higher clues.

However, considering that we visited Clue 1 at (4,0) and then moved rightward, visiting Clue 2 at (3,1), I should aim to get closer to a position where I can potentially access higher numbered clues efficiently. Since the next clue in order is indeed #4 but it's unclear where it is, my main goal should be to navigate towards a spot that allows easier access or potential leads to Clue #4.

Given this situation and looking at the available moves which are (3,2) and (4,3), I will evaluate both options.

3. EVALUATION:
- **Move: (3,2)**  
Pros: This move doesn't block any future paths significantly and could be a step towards potentially reaching higher numbered clues if Clue #4 is nearby or in a more accessible direction.
Cons: It doesn't directly contribute to visiting the next clue number (#4) since its location isn't specified.

- **Move: (4,3)**  
Pros: It moves closer to the right edge of the board and gives a broader view of the paths available for future moves. However, without knowing Clue #4's position, it might not be directly beneficial.
Cons: Similar to (3,2), this move doesn't guarantee movement towards a specific clue, especially since Clue #4 is unknown.

Given these considerations and looking at the goal of progressing in ascending order but lacking information about Clue #4's location, my best option would be to consider moves that do not block future paths and keep options open for accessing higher clues efficiently.

Considering this analysis and focusing on moving towards a position from where I can potentially find or get closer to clue numbers more effectively without blocking future paths, the move that allows me to maintain flexibility and access is:

DECISION:  
MOVE: (4,3)

This choice aims to keep my path open for potential future moves and doesn't specifically target Clue #4 but allows me to be positioned better for navigating through the board efficiently.

2025-12-10 11:43:10,503 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (4,2), and I have filled 3 out of 25 cells in my path so far. The current state of the board shows that I've visited clue numbers 1, 2, and 3 in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I need to visit all 5 clues, I should aim to find the next one on the list, which is Clue #4. Unfortunately, its location isn't provided, but I can try to deduce it or look for a lead to get closer to it. However, given the available information and current board state, my primary goal should be to move towards Clue #3, as we have not explicitly moved past it yet.

However, upon reviewing the clue numbers already visited, we realize that Clue #4's location isn't directly relevant at this moment since we're focusing on where to go next after visiting Clue #3. We actually need to think about moving towards our next visit in order which is indeed Clue #4 but given the available information and current state of the board, my primary goal should be to figure out how to get closer or position ourselves for future moves towards higher clues.

However, considering that we visited Clue 1 at (4,0) and then moved rightward, visiting Clue 2 at (3,1), I should aim to get closer to a position where I can potentially access higher numbered clues efficiently. Since the next clue in order is indeed #4 but it's unclear where it is, my main goal should be to navigate towards a spot that allows easier access or potential leads to Clue #4.

Given this situation and looking at the available moves which are (3,2) and (4,3), I will evaluate both options.

I am currently at position (3,2), which means I'm in the third row and second column of the grid. According to the current game state, I have filled 4 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from 1. The next clue number I need to visit is 3, but it's already marked on the board as being at position (2,3). However, since I'm currently two rows away and one column away from clue 3, I should consider visiting it soon.

However, my priority is to choose a move that doesn't block any future paths or create dead ends. Given this constraint, I need to think about the available next moves: (2,2), (3,1), and (3,3).

EVALUATION:
- Move to (2,2): This would put me one row below my current position and two columns away from clue 3. It's a viable option but might limit future path options.
  
- Move to (3,1): This move takes me directly towards the second clue number, which is at position (3,1). However, it's not yet marked on the board as being visited.

- Move to (3,3): This move would take me away from my current position and might create a dead end for future moves.

STRATEGY:
Based on the game state, my next priority is visiting clue 3 at position (2,3). Considering this, I should choose a move that sets me up to visit clue 3 soon.

**ANALYSIS**: I am currently at position (3,1), which is where Clue 2 is located. This means I've already visited Clue 2 and filled in its corresponding cell. According to the rules, I must now visit all clue numbers in ascending order, so my next target should be Clue 3.

**STRATEGY**: Since I need to visit Clue 3 next, I'll look for it on the board. The visual board state shows that Clue 3 is located at position (2,2). My task now is to plan a path from my current location (3,1) to (2,2).

**EVALUATION**: For each available move:

* **Move (2,1)**: This move would take me diagonally up and left, but the puzzle rules prohibit diagonal moves. So, I can't choose this option.
* **Move (3,0)**: If I move down to position (3,0), I'll be closer to Clue 4 and other empty cells that might help me reach Clue 3 more easily.

**DECISION**: Since moving diagonally is not allowed, my best option is to move down to position (3,0). This will allow me to explore the lower part of the board and get closer to Clue 4, which is located at position (2,3), just one row above Clue 3. By moving down first, I'm preparing a potential path for visiting Clue 3 in subsequent moves.

2025-12-10 11:43:36,106 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,0) and have filled 6 out of 25 cells. I need to visit all clues in ascending order, and so far, I've visited clue 2 at position (3,1). The next clue number is 3, but it's not directly adjacent to my current location. However, I notice that the path taken so far has been mostly along the bottom row of the board.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit should be 3. Looking at the board, it seems like a good idea to move upward from my current position to find its location. Clue 3 is located at (2,3), which is within reach if I move correctly.

EVALUATION: For each available move:
- Moving to (4,0) isn't viable since we've already visited that cell and clue 1.
- Moving to (2,0) would not only get me closer to the north but also potentially block any future paths to the top right part of the board if I need to backtrack.

DECISION:
Given my goal is to visit all clues in ascending order and considering the available next moves, moving to (2,0) is a strategic choice. It gets me closer to clue 3 at position (2,3), avoids revisiting cells already visited, and maintains flexibility for future path planning.

MOVE: (2,0)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 11:43:44,625 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,0), which is indicated by the [7] in the visual board state. I have filled 7 out of 25 cells so far and need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number to visit is Clue 3, which is located at position (4,1). However, since we can't move diagonally, the shortest path would be to get as close to (4,0) or (4,1) first. We already have Clue 2 at position (3,1), so visiting Clue 2 next is a good intermediate step.

3. EVALUATION:
   - Available Move: (1,0)
     Pros: This move doesn't block any future paths and allows us to get closer to the left edge of the board.
     Cons: It does not directly contribute to getting closer to Clue 2 or Clue 3.
   
   - Available Move: (2,1)
     Pros: This move gets us closer to the position where we can visit Clue 2 next. It doesn't block any future paths and keeps our path relatively straight.

4. DECISION:
Considering that we want to keep moving towards the right edge of the board and also towards Clue 2 (which is at (3,1)), the move to (2,1) seems more beneficial as it puts us in a better position to visit Clue 2 next while not blocking any future paths.

2025-12-10 11:44:02,181 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is at position (2,2). From my current position, I have three available moves: (0,1), (2,1), or (1,2).

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I'm currently in the middle of the board, having visited the first two clues and filled some of the surrounding cells.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
The next clue to visit is Clue 3, which is located at position (2,2). This requires me to move down from my current position.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

* Move (0,1): Pros - gets closer to potential horizontal paths, Cons - might limit vertical movement options.
* Move (2,1): Pros - directly moves towards Clue 3, Cons - could block potential future paths if I need to backtrack.
* Move (1,2): Pros - keeps me in the middle and prepares for vertical movement, Cons - doesn't bring me closer to Clue 3.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
Given my current position and the goal of visiting Clue 3, moving down to position (2,1) seems like the most efficient choice. It brings me directly towards the next clue without blocking potential future paths. This move sets up a clear path for visiting subsequent clues.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (2,1), having filled 10 out of 25 cells. The goal is to visit all clues in ascending order and fill all empty cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at position (4,3). However, before reaching clue 3, I must visit clue 2, which is at position (3,1) since my current path order is 1 -> 2.

Considering available moves from (2,1), the options are (0,1), (3,1), or (2,2). The move to (3,1) takes me directly to clue 2, which is the next required visit. This also sets up a good path for visiting subsequent clues while keeping future paths open.

EVALUATION:
- Moving to (0,1): This would take too long and waste potential horizontal moves.
- Moving to (2,2): Although this move doesn't block any paths, it's not the most efficient way to reach clue 2 since I'm already close to its location.

DECISION:
The best move is to directly go towards clue 2 at position (3,1) as it aligns with visiting all clues in ascending order and minimizes future path blockages.

I am currently at position (2,1), which means I'm already on a path that leads to one of the clues, and I've filled in some cells between them. The current situation shows that I need to continue filling in cells while visiting all clue numbers in ascending order.

My goal is to visit clue 3 next. According to the puzzle rules, I should move to the next higher numbered clue, which means going from Clue 2 (3,1) to Clue 3. However, since Clue 3's location is not explicitly given in the current state of the board, we must look at the overall path and available next moves.

From my current position (2,1), I have the following available next moves: moving up to (1,1) or (0,1), or staying put. But since there are no higher numbered clues between us and Clue 3, we will move towards an empty cell first before deciding which direction is best.

Now considering the available move of (2,2) as our starting point:

Evaluation:
 
* Moving up to (1,1): This would be a valid next move since it takes me closer to visiting all clue numbers in ascending order. However, this option requires further investigation.
* Moving to (0,1) is not an option with the current board state.

Given that there are no other available moves or clues that can help us decide on the optimal path at this point and our main goal of reaching Clue 3 soon, we will make a strategic decision based on what’s possible from the given position.

DECISION:
With these options in mind, it seems we should aim to fill more cells before moving up. As (2,1) is already occupied by me and I've filled in some nearby cells, going towards an empty cell near Clue 3 or starting a new path could be beneficial.

Given the available moves from our current position and considering our overall goal of reaching all clue numbers, the best next move should allow for us to make progress while keeping future paths open.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 11:44:33,658 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 10 out of 25 cells. My current situation is that I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, starting from the highest one already visited (which is Clue 3). Looking at the clues, my next goal should be to find and visit Clue 4, which would mean visiting a position with the number 4. According to the board state, there are two possible positions for the next clue: either (1,2), (2,2), or (3,2) because these are the only empty cells that can contain the number 4.

However, since I'm evaluating available moves, and considering I have a choice between (2,2) and other potential locations, my immediate priority is to choose the next move from (2,1). I notice that there are indeed two options: (3,0), (2,0), or (1,0) as possible destinations. These would get me closer to Clue 4's position but don't necessarily lead directly to it.

EVALUATION:
- Moving to (3,0): This move puts me in a potential path towards Clue 4 but could also block further movements if I need to backtrack.
- Moving to (2,0) or (1,0) would get me closer to the top of the board but doesn't directly lead to Clue 4's location without potentially backtracking.

DECISION:
Since my immediate next step is not directly towards Clue 4 but rather evaluating moves from (2,1), I need to choose between these options based on their immediate utility and potential for future movements. The move to (3,0) seems most promising because it places me closer to the top of the board and potentially along a path that could lead to Clue 4 without immediately blocking further movement.

However, upon re-evaluation considering the available next moves provided specifically at step 1, the immediate decision is between moving in different directions. Given that I was given options and must make a choice based on those directly stated for the next move (2,2), my task simplifies to evaluating the best use of this specific position.

Considering only the movement directly stated as available next moves ((2,2)), it seems I have not evaluated all possible paths efficiently in my initial reasoning. The most direct and logical step given the constraints and clue numbers visited so far is actually focusing on moving towards Clue 4, which would be at a lower numbered position than what I've described.

Therefore, considering the available next moves specifically provided for evaluation:

2025-12-10 11:47:44,751 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,2), which is Clue 1's location. The current path taken is just this one cell. Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, the next clue number to visit is 2. According to the board information, Clue 2 is located at position (1,3). To reach Clue 2, I need to move horizontally or vertically without revisiting any cells.

There are four available moves: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), and (2,3). 

EVALUATION:

* Move (1,2): This would put me closer to Clue 2 at position (1,3) by going down one row. However, this move could potentially limit my future options if I need to go left or right from the first row.
* Move (3,2): Moving up two rows and staying in the same column is not an efficient choice since it doesn't get me closer to Clue 2's location at (1,3).
* Move (2,1): This move would go left one column but only moves me away from Clue 2. It could also create a long path if I need to revisit the first row.
* Move (2,3): Going right one column doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2 at position (1,3).

DECISION:
Given that moving horizontally or vertically is required and revisiting cells must be avoided, the best move from my current position (2,2) towards visiting Clue 2 (located at (1,3)) would be to go down one row. This choice of going down doesn't limit potential future moves as much as moving left or right does.

Analysis: I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 25 cells. I need to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers, starting from 1 -> 2 -> ... -> highest. The current path is (2,2) -> (1,2). My goal is to find the most efficient path to continue visiting all clues.

Strategy: Next, I should visit Clue 2 at position (1,3), which is the next clue in ascending order after Clue 1.

Evaluation:

* Move to (0,2): This move would take me one row down but wouldn't bring me any closer to Clue 2. It also opens up possibilities for future moves.
* Move to (1,1): This option gets me one column left and is a possible way to approach Clue 2 without blocking paths. However, it might not be the most direct route.
* Move to (1,3): This move would take me directly to Clue 2 but could potentially limit my future path-finding options.

Decision: Based on these considerations, moving to (1,1) seems like a solid choice. It allows me to maintain some flexibility for future moves and doesn't block potential paths to other clues.

2025-12-10 11:47:52,115 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 11:47:52,115 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - Analysis: I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 25 cells. I need to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers, starting from 1 -> 2 -> ... -> highest. The current path is (2,2) -> (1,2). My goal is to find the most efficient path to continue visiting all clues.

Strategy: Next, I should visit Clue 2 at position (1,3), which is the next clue in ascending order after Clue 1.

Evaluation:

* Move to (0,2): This move would take me one row down but wouldn't bring me any closer to Clue 2. It also opens up possibilities for future moves.
* Move to (1,1): This option gets me one column left and is a possible way to approach Clue 2 without blocking paths. However, it might not be the most direct route.
* Move to (1,3): This move would take me directly to Clue 2 but could potentially limit my future path-finding options.

Decision: Based on these considerations, moving to (1,1) seems like a solid choice. It allows me to maintain some flexibility for future moves and doesn't block potential paths to other clues.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 3 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (1,3). Since I'm only one cell away from clue 2 in the x-direction, it's logical to move towards it.

EVALUATION:

* Move to (0,1): This would take me out of my current row and potentially block a future path. It also doesn't get me any closer to clue 2.
* Move to (2,1): Moving down two rows would put me in the same column as clue 2, but I'd have to revisit cells and it's not the most efficient way to get there.
* Move to (1,0): This move would take me out of my current column and doesn't bring me any closer to clue 2.

DECISION:
Considering the above evaluation, moving left one cell is the best option as it gets me closer to clue 2 without revisiting cells or blocking future paths.

I am currently at position (1,0), which is marked on the visual board. I have filled 4/25 cells so far and my path taken so far is (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0). I need to visit clue 3 next, but its location is not specified in this step.

However, looking at the clues provided, Clue 2 is located at position (1,3), and since I'm ascending order, I should visit it next. From my current position (1,0), I can move up or left to reach clue 2. I have two available moves: (0,0) and (2,0).

EVALUATION:
For each available move, the pros and cons are as follows:

- Move (0,0):
  - Pros: Moves me closer to Clue 2.
  - Cons: Requires backtracking if I decide to go left from this position.

- Move (2,0):
  - Pros: Moves me diagonally towards the right but still within a row. It would take me away from potential future paths on my current row and does not block any possible future moves in that direction.
  - Cons: Not moving directly towards Clue 2 or any previously marked path.

DECISION:
Considering my need to visit clue 2 next, and the available options, moving (0,0) is slightly better as it positions me closer to Clue 2 without immediately blocking potential paths on either side of my current row. This move does require some backtracking if I don't reach Clue 2 directly from here.

2025-12-10 11:48:14,130 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0), which means I have filled none of the cells except for my current position, and there are 25 cells to fill in total. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 1 first, which is located at position (2,2). From my current position, I can move up or right.

STRATEGY:
I should start by visiting clue 1, which is the lowest numbered clue and must be visited first.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving up to (0,1) gets me closer to clue 1 but doesn't fill any cells directly leading to it.
* Moving right to (1,0) also moves me towards clue 1, filling an empty cell along the way.

DECISION:
Both options are relatively neutral, with no significant advantages or disadvantages. However, since I need to visit all clues in ascending order and can't revisit a cell, I should start by moving up to (0,1), which will allow me to move towards clue 1 without blocking any future paths.

2025-12-10 11:48:26,258 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1), which means I'm in the first row and second column of the board. I have filled 6 out of 25 cells so far. Looking at the path taken so far, it appears that I started at clue number 2 and visited clues 3 and 4 in between before landing on my current position.

The visual board state shows that I'm surrounded by empty cells with no obstacles, which is good for navigation. However, I need to be mindful of visiting all clue numbers in ascending order and filling the necessary cells between them.

2. STRATEGY:
I should visit the next available clue number, which is Clue 3. However, we don't have its location yet since it's not provided. Since the last clue I visited was at position (1,2), I'll consider visiting the adjacent clues or the one below it to find Clue 3.

Given that Clue 2 was at (1,3) and the path has been going eastward so far, my next move should try to get closer to (1,3).

However, looking closely at the puzzle rules, I notice that we have an additional clue location provided: Clue 2 is indeed at position (1,3), but there's also a mention of Clue 1 being at position (2,2). Since we're currently ascending in our clue visits and haven't visited any clues beyond Clue 2 yet, I should actually visit the next available clue, which would be Clue 1.

Since Clue 1 is located at position (2,2), my current task is to get closer to that location. This means I can move northward from my current position (0,1).

3. EVALUATION:
From my current position (0,1), the available moves are indeed: (0,2). Since we have only one option here, there's no need for a comprehensive evaluation of pros and cons.

However, considering that I want to move northward towards Clue 1 at (2,2) and given the rules of the game, this single available move aligns perfectly with my goal.

4. DECISION:
Based on the above analysis and strategy, the most suitable next move is to go directly up from the current position.

I am currently at position (0,2), which means I have just filled the cell that was already filled on my previous path. My current situation is that I've filled 7 out of 25 cells, and I need to visit every clue in ascending order.

The next clue number I should visit is Clue 3, but it's not visible yet. However, we know that Clue 2 is located at position (1,3). Given my current location and the available clues, visiting Clue 2 is the next logical step.

Now let's evaluate each possible move from my current position:

* Move to (0,3): This would put me in the same row as Clue 2 but wouldn't be closer to it. It might also block future paths or create an unnecessary detour.
* Move to (1,2): While this gets me closer to Clue 2, it doesn't guarantee that I'll reach it sooner than if I go through other possible moves.

However, since the available next move is explicitly stated as (0,3), let's re-evaluate our strategy considering this constraint. Since we want to visit Clue 2 at (1,3) and we can only make a horizontal or vertical move from (0,2), moving to (0,3) gets us closer to the clue.

I am currently at position (0,3) and have filled 8 out of 25 cells. My current situation shows that I've already visited clue 1 at position (2,2). The next clue to visit is clue 2, which is located at position (1,3).

STRATEGY:
Since the goal is to fill all cells in one continuous path and visit all clues in ascending order, my next move should be towards clue 2.

EVALUATION:

**Available Move 1: (1,3)**
Pros: This move takes me directly to clue 2.
Cons: I might end up revisiting a cell or getting stuck if I'm not careful about the path back to higher-numbered clues.

**Available Move 2: (0,4)**
Pros: This move keeps my options open for future moves and allows me to fill in empty cells along the way.
Cons: It doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 immediately, but it might be a necessary step if I need to backtrack later.

DECISION:
Given that visiting all clues in ascending order is crucial, I should prioritize reaching clue 2 as soon as possible. Moving directly to (1,3) would be the most efficient way to do this, even though it carries some risk of getting stuck. Considering my current position and the need for forward progress, moving directly to (1,3) seems like the best choice.

2025-12-10 11:48:42,010 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - I am currently at position (0,3) and have filled 8 out of 25 cells. My current situation shows that I've already visited clue 1 at position (2,2). The next clue to visit is clue 2, which is located at position (1,3).

STRATEGY:
Since the goal is to fill all cells in one continuous path and visit all clues in ascending order, my next move should be towards clue 2.

EVALUATION:

**Available Move 1: (1,3)**
Pros: This move takes me directly to clue 2.
Cons: I might end up revisiting a cell or getting stuck if I'm not careful about the path back to higher-numbered clues.

**Available Move 2: (0,4)**
Pros: This move keeps my options open for future moves and allows me to fill in empty cells along the way.
Cons: It doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 immediately, but it might be a necessary step if I need to backtrack later.

DECISION:
Given that visiting all clues in ascending order is crucial, I should prioritize reaching clue 2 as soon as possible. Moving directly to (1,3) would be the most efficient way to do this, even though it carries some risk of getting stuck.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 11:48:49,661 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,3) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is not yet visible on the board. However, my current path order shows that I visited clue 2's position earlier, so it should be time for me to move to the correct location of clue 3.

According to the legend, I've already passed through (0,3) in my path order and now have a blank space between clues 1 and 2. So, the next clue number should indeed be at position (3,3), which is currently an empty cell. To reach this location from (1,3), I need to move one step down to fill that gap.

EVALUATION:
For each available move: 
(2,3): Moving here will not help me in any way; it's just moving horizontally without contributing to my path.
(1,4): This move would take me away from the vertical path and potentially create a dead-end later on if I can't backtrack.

DECISION:
Considering that (0,3) is already passed through, I should fill in the blank space between clues 1 and 2 first. Then, from there, I'll be able to follow my ascending order of clue numbers properly.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,3) with a path of length 9 out of 25 cells filled. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, and my current position is one cell ahead of Clue 2. The next available clue is Clue 3.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is Clue 3. However, there's no direct information about the location of Clue 3. Since we're dealing with a 5x5 grid and I'm at (2,3), the possibilities for Clue 3 are limited. Given that I have to move in an ascending order, it's likely that Clue 3 is either above or diagonally left from my current position.

3. EVALUATION:
Available next moves: 
- Move to (3,3): This would be a horizontal move, placing me directly above the current position. However, I'm not sure if there are any cells between us that need to be filled.
- Move to (2,4): This would place me diagonally to the right of my current position.

Pros and Cons for each available move:

Move to (3,3):
* Pros: Possible easier path towards Clue 3
* Cons: Limited information about cells between our positions

Move to (2,4):
* Pros: Diagonal moves are allowed, but they should be used judiciously as they may limit future options.
* Cons: May not lead directly towards Clue 3, given the constraints of the path.

4. DECISION:
Given that we need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and considering the limited information about cells between our positions, I'll opt for a move that gets me closer to a possible location of Clue 3 while keeping options open for future moves.

* Available Move (1,4): If I move up one row, I can fill an empty cell before reaching clue number 3 again. However, this won't directly lead me to any new or higher-numbered clues.
* Available Move (3,4): Moving down three rows and filling empty cells will eventually lead me away from my current position.

**DECISION:** Since both moves don't provide a direct path to clue number 4 or subsequent clues, I need to make a strategic decision. I have already visited clue number 2 at position (1,3), so visiting the next available clue should be my priority. Considering my goal is to visit all cells in ascending order, and there are no high-numbered clues close by, moving down three rows might seem like an option to access further regions of the board.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this move (3,4) would place me far away from any previously visited clue locations or my current path. Since visiting all cells exactly once is crucial, it's more efficient to stay within the vicinity of my previous clues and try to connect with existing paths.

**DECISION UPDATE:** Given these considerations, I will choose the move (1,4) over (3,4). Although this doesn't immediately help me find clue number 4 or any higher-numbered clues, it keeps me close to the path taken so far and allows for potential future connections.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 11:49:22,712 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,4), which is a filled cell, and have completed a significant portion of the path so far. The current path taken is: (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4). I have already visited clue 1 at position (2,2), and the next clue to visit is clue 2 at position (1,3).

2. STRATEGY:
Since we need to follow the order of clues in ascending order, my next goal is to visit clue 2 at position (1,3). We have already passed through this cell before when moving from (0,3) to (1,3), but we didn't fill a clue there yet.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move:

- Move to (1,4):
    - Pros: This move gets me closer to the next set of empty cells that can potentially be part of my path.
    - Cons: Since I am at position (2,4) and need to visit clue 2 at (1,3), moving in this direction does not help achieve the immediate goal of reaching clue 2.

- Move to (3,4):
    - Pros: This move is away from my current path but doesn't block any future paths.
    - Cons: It doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 at (1,3) and requires filling additional empty cells which might not be necessary given the constraints of the puzzle.

Given these considerations, moving towards the area with fewer constraints seems like a better option. Since I'm trying to reach (1,3), the move that gets me closer to this point without unnecessary detours is preferable.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal to visit clue 2 at position (1,3) and evaluating the available moves, moving towards this direction by choosing one of the available next moves makes sense. However, it's crucial to select a move that does not block potential future paths or unnecessarily detour from the main objective.

MOVE: (3,4)

Note: This response aims to adhere closely to the step-by-step format requested while considering all given information and puzzle constraints.

Looking at my path taken so far, I notice that I'm still following an irregular shape to get around the board. My current goal is to find a more efficient route to visit all remaining clues.

Strategy:
The next clue number I need to visit is not explicitly stated, but based on the ascending order rule (clue numbers 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest), it seems that I should aim for visiting Clue 10 or any subsequent high-numbered clue.

Evaluation:
(1) Move to (4,4):
Pros: I'm trying to move towards higher-numbered clues.
Cons: This move takes me out of my current row and might not get me closer to the next clue in a straightforward manner. Also, it's possible that the path could become more complicated with this move.

Pros: This move gets me closer to the middle of the board, which might provide better opportunities for visiting higher-numbered clues.
Cons: However, I'm not sure if there are any high-numbered clues located near (3,3).

Decision:

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

2025-12-10 11:49:44,913 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

I am currently at position (3,4), having filled 12 out of 25 cells. My current path taken includes visiting Clue 1 and Clues 2-11 in ascending order. Looking ahead to the next clue numbers to visit, I see that the highest numbered clue left to visit is not yet determined because all clues have been visited up to this point. Therefore, my immediate goal is not necessarily to find a specific clue number but rather to create a path that allows me to continue visiting in ascending order.

However, since Clue 2 has already been visited and I need to maintain the continuous path with filled cells between clues as needed, the next clue I should aim to visit must be in ascending order. Given my current position (3,4), moving closer to a higher numbered clue makes sense because it increases the likelihood of being able to continue the path in ascending order.

Evaluating available moves: For each move at (4,4) and (3,3):

- Moving to (4,4):
  - Pros: It's in a corner position which might help guide the path towards the next clue.
  - Cons: This move does not seem directly beneficial for reaching a specific clue number because it is higher up on the board. However, my strategy should be to continue filling cells and maintain the path's continuity.

- Moving to (3,3):
  - Pros: It positions me closer to the middle of the board, which could potentially offer better movement options or help in aligning with future clues.
  - Cons: Like moving to (4,4), this doesn't seem directly beneficial for reaching a higher clue number but does contribute to filling the board.

Given that neither move seems optimal for reaching a specific clue due to their positions on the board and my current goal of visiting clues in ascending order, I need to think about which action will best allow me to continue moving upwards towards higher numbered clues while also ensuring I maintain a continuous path.

DECISION:
Since both moves have similar drawbacks but offer slightly different strategic advantages (moving to (3,3) might offer more flexibility in future paths while moving to (4,4) puts you into a corner position that could guide the path), considering my current goal of ascending order and filling cells as needed between clues, I should choose the move that best supports my immediate need to create space for future moves upwards. Given this scenario, moving to (3,3) seems more beneficial in terms of flexibility and allowing future movement towards higher clue numbers.

2025-12-10 11:49:53,508 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

I am currently at position (3,3), which means I'm in the bottom-right part of the board. According to the Current Game State, my progress is 13/25 cells filled, indicating that there are still a significant number of empty cells to fill.

Analyzing the available clues, Clue 2 is located at position (1,3). Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, visiting Clue 2 next is a priority. The current position is relatively close to Clue 2, so moving towards it makes sense.

EVALUATION:

For each available move:
- **(4,3)**: This move would take me two cells up from my current position. It doesn't seem directly aligned with reaching Clue 2 at (1,3). However, it's worth considering because it could potentially open up a path to the top of the board.
  
- **(3,2)**: Moving one cell left brings me closer to both the center and the potential paths that lead towards Clue 2. Given the layout of the puzzle, moving horizontally seems more promising than moving vertically or diagonally.

DECISION:

Given the proximity to Clue 2 and considering the available moves, I think **(3,2)** is a better choice. It brings me closer to the clue and doesn't seem to block any future paths as strongly as moving up (4,3) could. This move seems to align well with my current situation and the strategy of visiting clues in ascending order.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (3,1) and have filled 15 out of 25 cells. I need to visit clue 4 next, but it's not explicitly mentioned where it is located. However, looking at the available moves, I notice that they all point to either moving down or staying in the same column as my current position.

Clue 3 is already visited and clue 4 could be anywhere on the board, but given that we need to fill all cells in one continuous path, visiting clue 4 next means it must be located somewhere that allows me to reach other unvisited clues. 

The available moves are: (2,1), (4,1), and (3,0). 

Let's evaluate each option:

- Move to (2,1): This move would put me below my current position and allow me to visit clue 4 if it exists there or somewhere nearby.
- Move to (4,1): This move would put me at the bottom row and may not provide an easy way to reach other clues. However, I could still potentially fill in some of the cells on this row.

Considering these options and the need to keep my path continuous and connected, visiting clue 3 was part of filling a necessary gap between clue numbers. Now we must find a suitable location for our next move that will get us closer to reaching all remaining clues.

However, given the current state of the board, I can see a more promising strategy by considering what clue number comes after the one already visited, and finding an optimal path to reach it.


EVALUATION:
Since we don't know where clue 4 is located, but need to move forward, our next task should be to find the correct sequence of moves that will enable us to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. 

Considering this, I think moving to (2,1) would provide a possible path forward by potentially reaching the row below me and allowing for more flexibility in my future moves.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number should be 3 since it is the highest one that hasn't been visited yet.


DECISION:
Considering all factors above and with no additional information about clue locations, moving to (2,1) seems like a good move as it allows potential progress towards reaching all clues.

I am currently at position (3,1), which is indicated by [15] on the board. I've already filled 15 out of 25 cells and my current path is quite long. I need to visit clue 4 next, but it's not explicitly mentioned where clue 4 is located. However, considering the previous moves, we can deduce that the clue numbers are usually at a distance from each other. Since the last visited clue was [11] at position (3,4), and my current position is also on the same column, I should visit a clue further down.

Looking at the available next moves, which are (2,1), (4,1), or (3,0), I think visiting clue 4 would be beneficial. Clue 4 is likely located at the bottom of the board, considering my previous path and the filled cells.

STRATEGY:
The highest numbered clue I can visit next is indeed [12] at position (3,2) doesn't seem to be it, as it's not in the available moves list, or maybe it was already visited and I missed that. It seems more likely that Clue 4 is located at a lower row.

EVALUATION:
Available next move (1) [(2,1)]:
- Pros: Visiting a new clue would be beneficial.
- Cons: Moving to (2,1) might not get me closer to the final path.

Available next move (2) [(4,1)]:
- Pros: This position seems likely for Clue 4 or an empty cell that will help me reach it in the future.
- Cons: It's a longer horizontal move than I'd like at this point.

Available next move (3) [(3,0)]:
- Pros: It gets me closer to the bottom of the board, potentially helping with my next moves.
- Cons: However, this move is not as efficient for visiting Clue 4 or another clue, if that's where it is.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis and strategy, I think moving down one row would be beneficial. Although (2,1) seems like a clue location, the current board state and available moves suggest visiting an empty cell at the bottom of the board might help with future path construction.

I am currently at position (4,1), having filled 16 out of 25 cells in my path. I have already visited clues 1 and 2, so my next goal is to visit clue 3, which is located at position (3,0). The available moves are (4,0) and (4,2).

STRATEGY:
Since I need to visit clue 3, my primary focus is on reaching it. Clue 3 is at the top-left corner of the board, so I should aim for that area.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (4,0): This move takes me directly towards clue 3's location. If I go to (4,0), I'll be one step closer to clue 3 and can continue from there.
	+ Pros: Directly approaches clue 3
	+ Cons: Might limit future options if not careful with path construction

* (4,2): This move takes me diagonally down-right but doesn't directly approach clue 3. It seems less efficient for reaching clue 3.

Given the analysis above, I choose to move (4,0) because it directly approaches clue 3's location, and from there, I can continue building my path towards other clues.

2025-12-10 11:50:45,501 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,0), having completed a path that started at clue 1 (2,2) and visited several cells in ascending order. As per the game state, I have filled 17 out of 25 cells. The current goal is to end my path at the highest numbered clue.

Looking ahead, I need to visit the next available clue, which is clue number 3. However, it's not directly adjacent to my current position (4,0). After some analysis, I realize that I can't visit clue 2 again because it's already been visited. The logical step would be to find a path that includes a sequence of cells leading me towards the next available clue.

I can move from my current position (4,0) to various adjacent cells: (3,0), (5,0), or go back in the reverse order. Given the available options and considering the board structure, I need to find a path that sets me up for visiting clue 3.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit is indeed Clue 3. From my research, Clue 3's location is at (4,2), but unfortunately, we are not directly allowed to see this information yet; instead, the clue locations are hidden in the board.

EVALUATION FOR EACH MOVE:

- **Move (3,0)**: This would take me towards the top row of the board. However, considering my current goal of visiting Clue 3 (but we don't know where it is), and having already filled many cells near this path, moving to (3,0) might not be the most efficient way forward.

- **Other moves**: The problem does not explicitly allow for backward movements beyond the immediate past position. Thus, considering my current situation, moving forward or staying within a reasonable distance from my path seems like the best strategy.

DECISION:
Given that I have to visit clue 3 next and I'm at (4,0), I need to figure out where Clue 3 is located. Although I can't see the location directly yet, visiting it implies moving towards the top row, considering our standard puzzle-solving behavior. The most efficient move for me, given my current progress and the structure of the board, would be to move up one row but also consider a path that could potentially lead to Clue 3 efficiently.

I am currently at position (3,0) and have filled 18 out of 25 cells according to the game state. My path has already visited many positions, including the clues 1 at (2,2) and 2 at (1,3). I need to continue visiting the remaining clue numbers in ascending order.

Looking at the current board state, I notice that there are several empty cells between the filled ones, which means I can move horizontally or vertically without revisiting a cell. The available next moves according to the problem statement are both horizontal and vertical options from my current position (3,0), but only one option is given: moving to position (2,0).

From this position, my next goal is to visit clue 3 at an unknown location. However, based on the clue locations provided earlier, I can assume that the remaining clues will be located in a similar pattern or close to each other.

EVALUATION:
The available move (2,0) takes me closer to the middle of the board and potentially reduces the number of empty cells between clues. This might make it easier to find and visit future clue locations.

Considering the pros:

* Moving to (2,0) brings me closer to the center of the board.
* It doesn't block any potential paths or require backtracking if I need to move in a different direction later.

The cons are minimal since we have not yet determined which clue number should be visited next.

DECISION:
Given that my current position is (3,0), moving to (2,0) seems like the most logical and straightforward choice. This will allow me to re-evaluate my path and potentially plan the next steps more efficiently.

2025-12-10 11:51:05,291 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0), and I have already visited many cells, with 19 out of 25 cells filled. According to the board state, my current path order is: (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0). Looking at the board state, I see that there are some empty cells in between my current path and clue 2, which is located at position (1,3).

STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit clue 2, as it's in ascending order from the previous clue. Clue 2 is located at position (1,3), so I need to find a way to get there.

EVALUATION:
My available next moves are: (2,1). However, since (2,1) is not an option for me to move directly towards clue 2 from my current position, I will consider it as the only possible move in this step. Let's evaluate its pros and cons:

Pros of moving to (2,1): This move allows me to get closer to the empty cell between clues 3 and 4.

Cons of moving to (2,1): It doesn't bring me any closer to clue 2.

DECISION:
Considering that I can only move one step at a time and my goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, moving to (2,1) is the best option for now. This will allow me to get ready for my next move towards clue 2.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 11:51:12,599 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) with a filled board state showing that I have visited several cells already. Upon examining the current game state, I see that I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at an empty cell marked as [8]. However, I also notice that I can reach both clues 4 and 5 by going down from my current position.

Looking at the available moves from (2,1), I have a few options:

* Move up: (2,0) - This would put me back on the second row but doesn't bring me closer to clue 3 or any other unvisited clues.
* Move right: (3,1) - This move takes me away from my potential path to reach clue 3 and might block future paths if I need to revisit this column later.
* Move down: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) - Moving down allows me to potentially visit either clue 5 at position (4,2) or continue exploring other cells.

However, the most appealing option is moving down to position (3,1). This move opens up more possibilities for reaching clue 3 and getting closer to the lower right part of the board.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 11:51:35,482 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
Analysis:
I am currently at position (2,1), and my path has taken a turn to fill cells in a seemingly random order. According to the progress, 20 out of 25 cells are filled, which means I've made significant progress on this puzzle. The current position is adjacent to Clue 1 at (2,2), but we need to move further.

Strategy:
The next clue number should be visited in ascending order, so I must head towards Clue 3. However, looking at the board, there's no direct path from my current location (2,1) to Clue 3's potential locations. Therefore, our primary goal is to get closer to Clue 3 while ensuring we don't revisit any cells and that our next move fills an empty cell.

Evaluation:
From my current position at (2,1), the available moves are:

* Moving down to (3,1) would require us to fill a cell between us and our destination. This doesn't seem ideal since it could limit future paths.
* Moving right to (2,2) is not an option because we've already been there in the path history.
* We can move up to (1,1), but this might not be the best choice as it doesn't bring us closer to Clue 3 directly and might create more obstacles later on.

However, after re-examining my previous moves and the current state of the board, I realized that moving right from (2,1) to (2,3) and then down to (3,3), or even trying a move up to (2,0), could be beneficial. But considering we are looking for Clue 3, which must be located after (2,2) on the board, these moves do not bring us closer to that destination.

But moving right from (2,1) is our next optimal choice since it sets up a path for future moves and does not create an obstacle in our way. 

Decision:
The best move seems to be moving right from my current position at (2,1), but this would take me towards Clue 2's location rather than directly progressing towards Clue 3.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (1,1), which is also where Clue 1 is located. I have already visited this cell and filled it with a clue number (Clue 1). Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order, my next goal is to find the location of Clue 2.

STRATEGY:
The next clue I should visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (2,1). This means I need to move down one row from my current position.

EVALUATION:

* Available moves: (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), (1,2)
	+ Move to (0,1): Moving left would not bring me closer to Clue 2. It also doesn't seem like an efficient move.
	+ Move to (2,1): This is the exact location of Clue 2, but I need to consider whether it's feasible given my current position and the constraints of the puzzle.
	+ Move to (1,0): Moving up would take me away from the column where Clue 2 is located. It doesn't seem like an optimal choice at this point.
	+ Move to (1,2): While this move would take me in a generally downward direction, it's not directly towards Clue 2.

DECISION:
The most efficient next step would be to move down from my current position, which is (1,1), and aim for the column where Clue 2 is located. Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order, moving down one row will bring me closer to the next clue while also keeping future paths open.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,0), which is the starting point of Clue 1. I have filled only one cell out of nine. My goal is to visit all clues in ascending order while filling empty cells between them.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number to visit is Clue 2. According to the board information and clue locations, there isn't a specific location for Clue 2 provided yet. However, since we need to move from (2,0) to (1,0), (0,1), or another position that might lead us closer to Clue 2's unknown location.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
   - **(1,0)**: Moving down is the only way to continue in ascending order of clues without any additional information on the next clue's location. However, this move might not be optimal if we consider finding a more efficient path.
   - **(2,1)**: Although it moves diagonally, which isn't allowed according to the rules, there seems to have been an oversight in evaluating available moves since (2,1) isn't an option provided by the game state. The correct evaluation should focus on horizontal or vertical movements only.

4. DECISION: Given the information and focusing on a move that adheres to the rules, I must choose between moving horizontally left or finding another move that's not listed but could potentially be beneficial based on future moves. Since (2,1) isn't an option due to being a diagonal move, my best next step under these conditions is to choose the horizontal move.

I am currently at position (1,0), and I have filled 2 out of 9 cells. The next clue to visit in ascending order is Clue 3, which is located at position (0,1). My goal is to reach the highest numbered clue, but first, I need to fill all cells between Clues 1 and 3.

Available moves are either (0,0) or (1,1).

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (0,0):
	+ Pros: Gets me closer to Clue 3 at position (0,1), but it also fills a cell that I could have used to connect with the right side of the board.
	+ Cons: This might limit my future options for reaching higher numbered clues on the left side.
* Moving to (1,1):
	+ Pros: Connects me to the middle row and opens up possibilities for moving either horizontally or vertically towards Clue 3 at position (0,1).
	+ Cons: Fills a cell that I could have used to explore other parts of the board more efficiently.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis, I think it's best to move to (1,1) because it provides flexibility and opens up more paths for future moves. This choice allows me to keep my options open for reaching higher numbered clues in any direction while making progress towards Clue 3 at position (0,1).

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 12:46:51,265 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, but since the highest numbered clue is not yet visible, my next move should be towards the area where the next clue might be located. According to the current board state, clue number 2 is already placed at position (1,2) and there's an empty cell next to it at (0,2). However, I also need to consider other available moves.

Considering the available next moves:

* Move to (0,1): This move would take me horizontally, but from my current position, I'm not sure if this is leading towards any clue or blocking a possible future path. I'd be filling an empty cell, but it's not clear how this will help me reach other clues.
* Move to (2,1): This move takes me vertically down and places me in a new row with two empty cells and the possibility of reaching higher-numbered clues if they're placed there. However, I'm also moving away from clue number 3 that's already marked at position (2,0).
* Move to (1,2): This is an invalid move since it would place me on top of an existing clue (number 2).

However, considering the pros and cons of each available next move, my current priority is to advance along a row or column while keeping options open for future moves. 

Given that I'm already at position (1,1) with two empty cells in front of me and two other positions where clues are located (clue 2 is at position (1,2), and clue 1 at position (2,0)), moving vertically down to (2,1) seems like a good choice as it opens up possibilities for reaching the upper part of the grid if any higher-numbered clues were placed there.

I am currently at position (2,1), having visited clues 1 and 2 already in ascending order. I have filled 4 out of 9 cells on this path. Since I need to visit clue numbers in ascending order, the next clue to visit is 3.

The available next moves are (0,0) or (2,2). Since my current goal is to find the location of clue 3, let's examine each possible move:

**Move 1: (0,0)**
Pros:
- Reaches a new row and potentially shortens the path
Cons:
- Requires revisiting a previously filled cell at position (0,2), which might not be efficient in finding clue 3

**Move 2: (2,2)**
Pros:
- Immediately places us near the top-right corner of the grid
Cons:
- Might lead away from the optimal path if clue 3 is located elsewhere, potentially forcing a longer detour to get back on track.

Considering my goal and the pros and cons of each move, moving to (2,2) seems more promising. This position allows me to explore the top-right corner without immediately deciding that it's where clue 3 must be. If clue 3 is found there, great! Otherwise, I can easily backtrack or continue exploring based on future clues.

2025-12-10 12:47:11,957 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,2), which has a path number of 5 and I've visited all clues up to this point. Looking at the board, there are only two empty cells left to fill between clue 4 and clue 6. Since my goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, my next step should be visiting clue 3.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is 3. According to the rules, I must follow a continuous path and never revisit any cell. Looking at the board, I can see that there are two empty cells between clue 2 (at position (1,1)) and the upper-left quadrant of the board.

EVALUATION:
For each available move (1,2), which is the only option given:

- Moving to (1,2) doesn't bring me closer to clue 3 or help in filling any other empty cell.
- It doesn't block any future paths but neither does it help advance my path forward according to the rules.

DECISION:
Given that moving to (1,2) doesn't contribute to visiting clue 3 next or filling an empty cell necessary for a continuous path, and considering I've only one option available:

MOVE: (1,2)

However, considering the constraints of this puzzle, I believe there was an oversight in the evaluation step given the specific options provided. Since I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at position (0,2), moving to (1,2) directly takes me closer to it but doesn't necessarily fill a necessary empty cell between clues or advance my path according to the ascending order rule without considering potential future moves that might require backtracking.

Upon reevaluation based on the puzzle's constraints and available information:
- The optimal move under the provided options should indeed aim at taking me towards clue 3 without reconsidering available options for filling cells in a manner that adheres strictly to the rules given (ascending order of clues, no revisiting, etc.), which suggests moving towards (0,2) directly.

MOVE: (1,2)

Given this step's evaluation might have missed the critical path forward under normal circumstances, and acknowledging my initial assessment did not correctly apply the puzzle's constraints to the provided options:

The optimal next move should still aim at reaching clue 3 without reconsidering available paths or backtracking.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

Analysis: I am currently at position (1,2), having filled 6 out of 9 cells in my path so far. The visual board state shows that I have visited clue numbers 1, 2, and 6, and the empty cells are not blocking any future paths. My goal is to visit all 9 cells exactly once.

Strategy: Next, I need to visit the next highest numbered clue, which is clue number 3. Looking at the coordinate grid, clue number 3 must be located in a position that hasn't been visited yet and has not blocked my path to future clues. Since I'm trying to fill all empty cells between clues as needed (rule 7), it's likely that the next clue will be near one of the existing clues.

Evaluation: For each available move, considering the pros and cons:

- Moving to (0,2) would get me closer to potential clue locations in the top row, but I'd be entering new territory without knowing where the next clue is.
- Since I need to visit clue 3, it's likely that the empty cell at position (1,2), which I'm currently standing on, should be filled with a subsequent clue number. In this case, since clue numbers 1 and 2 are already visited, the remaining clue at (1,2) is indeed clue number 6 (already marked in the visual board). 

Decision: Given my analysis, strategy, evaluation, and understanding of the rules, I should not move to (0,2), as it would lead me away from potential future paths. Instead, since I'm already standing on an empty cell that needs to be filled with a subsequent clue number, I'll simply visit clue 3 at position (1,1).

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 6 out of 9 cells, which means I'm halfway through solving the puzzle. The goal is to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers. My current path taken so far is (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2). Since I have already visited all the cells in column 1 except for (1,0), my next move should be towards clue 3, which is at position (1,1). However, I notice that there's an empty cell between clue 2 and the current position (1,2) at position (1,1).

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue 3, located at position (1,1). The clue numbers are in ascending order, so the next logical step after clue 1 is indeed clue 2, but I have already visited that. Now, I need to move towards clue 3.

EVALUATION:
From my current position (1,2), the available moves are: (0,2) or (2,2). However, moving in either direction won't get me closer to clue 3 at position (1,1). To reach clue 3, I need a move that allows me to go back one row while staying on the same column.

DECISION:
Since I want to visit clue 3 and going horizontally or vertically would lead me further away from it, the best option is to fill an empty cell between the current position (1,2) and the destination (1,1). This involves moving up a single cell in this case.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 12:47:50,691 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2), which is a crucial step in the path as it's one of the few filled cells between clues. I've already filled 7 out of 9 cells and have visited clue numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 in that order. The next clue number to visit should be 4, but I don't see it on the board yet.

The available next move is (0,1), which is a horizontal move to the left from my current position. 

However, before making any moves, I need to think about the optimal path and how to incorporate clue number 4 into the existing path.

From my current position (0,2), moving to (0,1) gets me closer to where the missing clue number 4 could be. If I fill in the blank with a "4", it would mean that I'm still following the ascending order of clue numbers (7 -> 8 doesn't exist yet).

Given the layout and my current position, I don't see any other clues or available moves that would allow me to incorporate the next clue number without creating an obstacle for myself.

EVALUATION:
From my current position (0,2), I have two potential paths: (0,1) and potentially moving down a row if I need to fill in more cells between the 3rd row and 4th row. However, since we don't know where clue number 8 is located, it's best for now to focus on filling in the gaps closer to my current position.

DECISION:
The available next move (0,1) seems like a good choice, as it gets me closer to where I can incorporate the missing clue number 4 without disrupting the existing path. Since we don't know where clue 8 is located yet and the puzzle requires visiting all clues in ascending order, it's best not to get too far ahead of ourselves.

I am currently at position (0,1) with a partially filled path and 8/9 cells completed. The highest numbered clue that I have yet to visit is #5, but it's not my next move since the problem requires visiting clues in ascending order and I need to fill some empty spaces between them. I also note that I've already visited Clue 1 at position (2,0), so now I should head towards Clue 2.

Clue 2 is located at (1,1) which happens to be one of the few empty cells left. Given my current location is (0,1), visiting clue 2 would not only fulfill a puzzle requirement but also fill in an empty cell that's adjacent to it and other already visited clues, thus optimizing the path.

Evaluating available moves from (0,1) - moving up to (0,0) isn't as appealing because going through the starting point might complicate reaching Clue 2 efficiently. Similarly, moving right to position (0,2) or left to any other position doesn't bring me closer to visiting Clue 2 in ascending order.

Therefore, moving directly to (1,1) makes sense as it fulfills two main requirements: It moves me one step ahead in the problem's requirement of completing clues in order and fills an empty cell adjacent to already visited spaces.

2025-12-10 12:48:16,033 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0), which means I'm back to where I started. The game state shows that all 9 cells are filled, but upon reviewing my previous moves, I notice that there's no clue left to visit after the initial Clue 1 located at (2,0). The path taken so far doesn't seem optimal as it has retraced steps, filling empty cells in between clues unnecessarily. Given this situation, my goal should be to correct and optimize the path by ensuring all clues are visited in ascending order without revisiting any cells.

STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is Clue 3, but since the board state shows that only one cell is left to fill (at position (1,1)), it suggests that there might be an efficient move to get to Clue 3 directly or at least close to it without backtracking.

EVALUATION:
Given my current position and the need to correct my path, I have limited options. The available moves are constrained by my previous choices. 

- Moving to (1,0) could potentially help me in navigating towards Clue 3 but requires checking if it leads to a dead end.
- Moving to (0,1) or (1,2) seems less optimal as they do not bring me closer to the unvisited clue without risking backtracking further.

DECISION:
Considering I need to optimize my path and there's only one cell left empty at position (1,1), it makes sense to move directly into that spot. This fills in a necessary gap in my previous path, potentially allowing for future moves towards Clue 3 in an optimal way without unnecessary backtracking.

2025-12-10 12:48:17,059 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 12:48:24,938 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0), which is the top-left corner of the board. I have filled 8 out of 9 cells and have completed all clues in ascending order except for one more step to visit clue number 5, which is located at position (2,2). My current path has taken me through all other clue locations: (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (1,2), and (0,2).

Since I've reached the top-left corner, my next move should be to visit the highest remaining clue number. However, I need to consider that I'm stuck due to a lack of available moves.

STRATEGY:
My goal is to reach clue 5 at position (2,2). Since it's the last clue and I need to visit all clues in ascending order, my next step should be to move towards this location while ensuring I don't revisit any cells or block potential paths for future moves.

EVALUATION:
Considering the board layout and my current path, the only possible move from (0,0) is downwards to position (1,0), as moving left or right would not lead me closer to clue 5. The pros of this move are that it gets me one step closer to clue 5 and doesn't block any potential paths for future moves. The cons are minimal since I don't have many options.

DECISION:
Given the constraints of the puzzle, my best option is to move downwards to position (1,0).

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,0), which is the top-left corner of the board. I've completed a full loop and visited all clue numbers in ascending order, but I'm stuck because there's no clear next move that leads me to the highest numbered clue. The current path taken shows that I've filled 9/9 cells, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the path is not optimal.

2. STRATEGY:
The only available move left is to revisit a previous clue or backtrack to try different paths. Since all clues have been visited in ascending order, my next goal is to find a new, unvisited cell to fill. Given the current board state and path taken, I should aim for a cell that allows me to move closer to the highest numbered clue (5). However, since there are no available moves listed, it seems like I need to evaluate all possible paths to find a suitable next step.

3. EVALUATION:
Considering my current position at (0,0) and reviewing the path taken, I notice that there's an opportunity to backtrack from clue 2 (position (1,1)) to a previously unvisited cell or revisit a cell closer to the highest numbered clue. Given the symmetry of the board and my previous moves, I should look for a move that doesn't block any future paths.

4. DECISION:
After evaluating all possible next moves and analyzing the board state, I think it's best to revisit a previously unvisited cell or backtrack to try a different path. Since there are no obvious available moves listed, I will choose the most logical next step: revisit clue 1 at position (2,0). This move won't block any future paths and provides an opportunity to re-evaluate my progress.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 12:48:43,198 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,2), which is also the location of Clue 1. I have filled only 1 out of 9 cells so far. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (1,1). Visiting this clue will allow me to move forward with the path-finding process and continue filling cells in ascending order.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Available Next Moves:

- **Move to (1,2)**:
	+ Pros: This move doesn't block any future paths and allows for a potential next step towards Clue 2.
	+ Cons: It doesn't directly get me closer to Clue 2; it's more of a preparatory move.
- **Move to (2,1)**:
	+ Pros: This move gets me directly closer to Clue 2 and prepares the path for visiting it next.
	+ Cons: None apparent from my current position.

4. DECISION:
Based on the evaluation above, moving to (2,1) is the best choice because it directly contributes to visiting Clue 2 next, maintaining the ascending order of clue numbers, and not blocking any future paths.

2025-12-10 12:48:53,481 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,1), which means I'm one cell to the left of Clue 1, and two cells above Clue 2. My path taken so far is (2,2) -> (2,1). Since I've already visited the top-right corner with Clue 1, my next step should involve moving towards Clue 2.

2. STRATEGY:
Clue 2's location at position (1,1) indicates that it's on the diagonal from our current position. However, we need to reach all clue numbers in ascending order. Therefore, our immediate goal is to visit Clue 2, which will allow us to continue filling cells in a logical and efficient manner.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move:

- Available Move (1,1): 
This move gets me directly onto Clue 2's location. It doesn't require any additional steps to reach the next clue but might restrict future moves due to its proximity to other clues.
Pros: Reaches Clue 2 efficiently; Cons: Potentially restrictive for later paths.

- Available Move (2,0):
This move takes us down one row from our current position but does not directly contribute to reaching Clue 2 more quickly. It opens up space below but doesn't advance the progress towards visiting clue numbers in ascending order.
Pros: Opens new space for future moves; Cons: Doesn't directly aid in reaching Clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Given that we're trying to follow the ascending order of clue numbers and have already visited one clue, moving directly onto the second clue's location makes the most sense. This approach ensures we stay on track with our goal without unnecessarily opening up space for moves that wouldn't immediately contribute to solving the puzzle.

2025-12-10 12:49:03,112 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. I need to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. According to the clue locations, Clue 2 is already located here at (1,1), so it's not my next destination. My current situation indicates that I should move towards higher-numbered clues.

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit Clue 3, which is not yet revealed on the board. Since I need to fill all cells in one continuous path and cannot revisit a cell, I must create a new branch from my current position. The optimal location for Clue 3 would be adjacent to the highest numbered clue that has been visited so far.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (0,1): Moving up would allow me to reach the empty cells at row 0 without revisiting any cell or blocking future paths. However, this might not take me directly towards Clue 3.
* (1,0): Moving left would take me away from the central part of the board and potentially block some future paths. This move does not seem optimal for reaching Clue 3.
* (1,2): Moving right seems promising as it takes me closer to the potential location of Clue 3 while keeping my path open.

DECISION:
Considering the available moves and their pros and cons, I believe that moving up is the best choice. This allows me to create a new branch from my current position without revisiting any cell or blocking future paths. Although it doesn't take me directly towards Clue 3, it sets up a potential path for reaching higher-numbered clues.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1), and I have filled 4 out of 9 cells. The path taken so far is (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1). I need to continue visiting the clues in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is Clue 3. However, since Clue 2 is already visited, I can only move towards the empty cells between clues. The highest numbered clue I have not yet visited is indeed Clue 3, but its location is not provided in this step.

Upon reviewing the board again: Clues 1 and 2 are at positions (2,2) and (1,1), respectively. The next clue number should be 3, which might be located at position (0,0). 

However, considering that there's only one possible next move for visiting the next available clue or empty cell in this puzzle size: My analysis of Clue locations wasn't needed. We can see the available moves are between Clues 2 and 1 or the empty spaces.

3. EVALUATION:
I have two options: (0,0) or (0,2). 

Pros for moving to (0,0):
- It is a clue location which might be where I need to go next

Cons:
- None clear of why it's better than another move

Pros for moving to (0,2):
- This could lead me in the direction that allows me to find Clue 3.

However, since we're in a 3x3 grid and Clue 2 is already visited, Clue 3 must be either in position (0,0) or (0,2), as they are the only remaining positions that haven't been marked by Clues 1-2.

For each available move:

**Move to (0,0)**:
Pros: Gets me back to a top-left corner, allowing for potential horizontal and vertical paths. Might help in reaching Clue 3.
Cons: Takes away one of the two possible moves I have now (move to (0,2)), which could be useful later.

**Move to (0,2)**:
Pros: Keeps the option open for moving back to a top-left corner ((0,0)) or trying to reach Clue 3 at this end.
Cons: Moves away from potential paths to other cells, including the possibility of reaching more clues without going around too much.

Decision:
Based on available moves and the goal to visit all clue numbers in ascending order while filling empty cells between them as needed, I will move to (0,2).

2025-12-10 12:49:29,345 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2), having visited clues 1 and 2 in that order. I have filled 3 out of 9 cells so far. The clue numbers left to visit are 3 and above. My current situation indicates that I need to continue moving towards the top row to find a suitable path for clue 3.

Strategy:
Since I am currently at position (0,2), my next goal is to reach the next numbered clue. Given the available options, I should aim to move in a way that allows me to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. The most logical choice would be to find the location of clue 3 and plan my path around it.

Evaluation:
From position (0,2), the two available moves are either moving up one row ((1,2)) or moving diagonally-right-up ((0,1)). 

- Moving up: This keeps me on a potential horizontal line to move towards higher numbered clues. 
- Moving diagonally-right-up: Although this gets me closer to clue 3, which I haven't identified yet, it also slightly disrupts the direct ascending order and might create potential dead ends.

Decision:
Given that moving up maintains flexibility in reaching any row (including potentially reaching a horizontal line to move right), it seems more optimal than moving diagonally-right-up. This choice allows for an easy progression towards higher numbered clues without prematurely committing to specific horizontal or vertical paths that might become blocked later on.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 12:54:22,245 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,2), which is Clue 1, and I have filled 1 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit Clue 2 next, which is located at position (1,0). From my current position, I have three available moves: (3,2), (4,1), or (4,3).

STRATEGY:
Since I am starting with a high clue number and need to visit all clues in ascending order, the logical next step would be to move to Clue 2.

EVALUATION:

- **Move (3,2)**: This option is not ideal because it doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2. It's more of a lateral move and doesn't seem to offer any immediate advantage in getting me to the next clue.
  
- **Move (4,1)**: Moving horizontally from my current position would indeed bring me closer to the second clue, which is at (1,0). This option seems promising as it's directly moving towards Clue 2.

- **Move (4,3)**: Similar to moving to (3,2), this move doesn't seem as beneficial since it doesn't reduce the distance to Clue 2. It might even create an unnecessary detour if I don't have a reason to move in that direction immediately.

DECISION:
Given the options, moving horizontally towards the second clue at position (1,0) makes the most sense. This is because it directly reduces the distance between my current location and Clue 2 without creating unnecessary paths or blocking future moves.

For the move (3,1):
Pros: This move gets me closer to the top of the board and brings me towards clue 3. It also doesn't block any future paths.
Cons: Moving to (3,1) might limit my options for future moves.

For the move (4,0):
Pros: This move keeps me on the same row as clue 3, which could be beneficial in terms of getting closer to it.
Cons: However, moving to (4,0) puts me at a lower position on the board and doesn't bring me any closer to visiting other clues.

DECISION:
Considering my current path and goal of visiting all clues in ascending order, I think moving to (3,1) is the better choice. It gets me closer to clue 3 and keeps my options open for future moves.

2025-12-10 12:54:40,693 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (3,1), which is located between clues 1 and 4 in the top-right part of the board. The path taken so far is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1). Looking at the available moves, I need to decide where to go next to reach the remaining clues.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number should be clue 5 or higher. Clue 5 is located at position (1,4), which means I will need to move left from my current position or continue upwards.

EVALUATION:

Available Move 1: (2,1)
Pros: Moves me up and closer to the top-left part of the board.
Cons: Doesn't directly take me towards clue 5, but gets me out of the way for future possibilities.

Available Move 2: (3,0)
Pros: Moves me left and down simultaneously, which could be useful in reaching the bottom-right part of the board.
Cons: May limit my options if I need to revisit this area or move back up quickly.

Available Move 3: (3,2)
Pros: Moves me right, which keeps the current path somewhat linear. However, it doesn't directly help with visiting clue 5 yet.
Cons: This might create a longer path in the future and could block potential moves if I need to backtrack.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis, I believe that moving left (down) would be beneficial for now since it keeps options open for reaching both clue 4 and potentially moving down towards clue 6. However, considering the overall strategy of heading upwards towards clue 5, (3,0) seems like a more direct move compared to (2,1), which just moves up without making significant progress.

The next clue number should be clue 5 or higher. Clue 5 is located at position (1,4), which means I will need to move left from my current position or continue upwards.

EVALUATION:

Available Move 1: (2,1)
Pros: Moves me up and closer to the top-left part of the board.
Cons: Doesn't directly take me towards clue 5, but gets me out of the way for future possibilities.

Available Move 2: (3,0)
Pros: Moves me left and down simultaneously, which could be useful in reaching the bottom-right part of the board.
Cons: May limit my options if I need to revisit this area or move back up quickly.

Available Move 3: (3,2)
Pros: Moves me right, which keeps the current path somewhat linear. However, it doesn't directly help with visiting clue 5 yet.
Cons: This might create a longer path in the future and could block potential moves if I need to backtrack.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis, I believe that moving left (down) would be beneficial for now since it keeps options open for reaching both clue 4 and potentially moving down towards clue 6. However, considering the overall strategy of heading upwards towards clue 5, (3,0) seems like a more direct move compared to (2,1), which just moves up without making significant progress.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (3,0) and have filled 4 out of 25 cells. The current path taken is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0). My goal is to visit clue numbers in ascending order. So far, I've visited clues 1, 3, and 4.

STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit Clue 5, which is located at position (1,4).

EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

* Move to (2,0): This would bring me closer to clue 5, but it's not directly adjacent. It might be a good option if there were no other moves that get me closer or more convenient.
* Move to (4,0): I'd be going down instead of trying to move towards the east direction where Clue 5 is located.

DECISION: Considering the position and distance from Clue 5 at (1,4), moving to (2,0) seems like a better initial choice because it's slightly closer than moving straight down. It also opens up more potential paths for future moves compared to going directly south.

2025-12-10 12:54:59,221 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0), which is one of my available next moves according to the game state. I have filled 5 out of 25 cells so far. The current path taken is from Clue 1 (4,2) through a series of empty cells. My goal is to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 3, which is located at position (0,1). To get there from my current position, I can move either horizontally or vertically. 

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

- Moving to (2,1): This would take me diagonally and doesn't align with the required horizontal or vertical moves.
- Moving to (2,3) is not an option as it's outside my available next moves.

Among the two valid options given by the game state: 
- (1,0)  
- (2,1) 

EVALUATION OF EACH OPTION:
Moving to (1,0):
Pros: It gets me closer to Clue 3 at position (0,1).
Cons: This move doesn't allow for an immediate continuation on the path from Clue 3 to other clue locations. 

Moving to (2,1):
Pros: It's closer to my current position and allows a more direct approach towards Clue 4.
Cons: This move doesn't align with visiting Clue 3 first.

DECISION:
Since I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order and my next required step is to visit Clue 3, moving to (1,0) seems like the best option as it gets me closer to Clue 3. Although this path might not be the most direct at present, visiting Clue 3 first sets up the correct progression for the rest of the puzzle.

I am currently at position (1,0), which is the second clue I need to visit in ascending order. My current path is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0). There are 25 cells on the board, and I've filled 6 out of them so far.

STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is Clue 7. However, since Clue 5 and Clue 6 have already been placed on the board, I must assume that the next clue will be at a higher position. To determine which clue to visit next, I will evaluate the possible locations of Clue 7.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

1. Move to (0,0): This would take me away from any potential path to Clue 7 and might leave limited options for future moves.
2. Move to (1,1): From here, I could potentially access the upper-left part of the board and get closer to Clue 3 or other clues.

DECISION:
Considering the need to visit higher-clued locations, moving to (1,1) seems like a more strategic choice. It allows me to explore the upper-left area of the board, where potential clue locations might be available.

STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is Clue 7. However, since Clue 5 and Clue 6 have already been placed on the board, I must assume that the next clue will be at a higher position. To determine which clue to visit next, I will evaluate the possible locations of Clue 7.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 12:55:15,245 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,0), which is Clue 2's location. I have filled 6 out of 25 cells, and my path taken so far is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0). My next goal is to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (0,1).

STRATEGY:
My next clue to visit is indeed Clue 3, and it's situated at position (0,1). To reach this location, I need to move either horizontally or vertically.

EVALUATION: 
I have two available moves: (0,0) or (1,1). Let's evaluate each option:

- Move to (0,0): This would take me out of the way and create a longer path in the future. If I go this route, I'll need to revisit some cells to get back on track.
- Move to (1,1): This gets me one step closer to Clue 3 without creating any unnecessary detours.

DECISION:
Considering my current position and the goal of reaching Clue 3 efficiently, moving to (1,1) is the optimal choice. It allows me to stay focused on the correct path and visit subsequent clues in ascending order.

I am currently at position (1,1), having visited clues 1 and 2 in ascending order. My current path is (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). I have filled 7 out of 25 cells so far.

Considering my next move, the highest numbered clue left to visit is Clue 6 at position (1,3). However, since the path needs to be continuous and include all clues in ascending order, visiting Clue 5 (position (1,4)) would be more optimal before reaching Clue 6. Therefore, my next goal is to move towards Clue 5.

EVALUATION:
- Available moves: (0,1), (2,1), or (1,2).
- Pros and cons for each move:
  - (0,1): This move does not bring me closer to any clue. It would be a detour from the optimal path.
  - (2,1): Moving in this direction would get me closer to Clue 5 but doesn't align with my strategy of visiting clues in ascending order for now.
  - (1,2): This move is directly towards Clue 5 at position (1,4), which is the next clue I need to visit. It also fills an empty cell needed between the current and future paths.

DECISION:
Given that visiting Clues 3 and 4 are not required to be done in ascending order before reaching Clue 6 and considering my strategy of optimizing my path by moving towards the next required clue (Clue 5), the best move is to go directly to Clue 5 at position (1,4).

2025-12-10 12:55:33,964 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have already visited clue 1. The next clue I need to visit in ascending order is clue 2, which is located at position (1,0). My current path has me moving horizontally and vertically without revisiting any cells, so I don't have any restrictions on my movement.

STRATEGY:
Since the goal is to visit every cell exactly once and fill all clues in ascending order, my next step should be to reach clue 2. I already know its position at (1,0), which is adjacent to my current location. This will help me stay on track with visiting all clues in sequence.

EVALUATION:
Available moves are: (0,2), (2,2), and (1,3).

- Moving to (0,2) would bring me closer to the top of the board but not directly towards clue 2. This could be a good move if I wanted to explore other areas first.
- Moving to (2,2) takes me away from the path to clue 2 and might require backtracking later on.
- Moving to (1,3) puts me out of order because it skips clue 2.

DECISION:
The best move is to go directly to clue 2 at position (1,0). This keeps the puzzle progression linear and follows the ascending order of clues. It also allows for the most straightforward path forward.

2025-12-10 12:55:33,977 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 12:55:33,978 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - I am currently at position (1,2) and have already visited clue 1. The next clue I need to visit in ascending order is clue 2, which is located at position (1,0). My current path has me moving horizontally and vertically without revisiting any cells, so I don't have any restrictions on my movement.

STRATEGY:
Since the goal is to visit every cell exactly once and fill all clues in ascending order, my next step should be to reach clue 2. I already know its position at (1,0), which is adjacent to my current location. This will help me stay on track with visiting all clues in sequence.

EVALUATION:
Available moves are: (0,2), (2,2), and (1,3).

- Moving to (0,2) would bring me closer to the top of the board but not directly towards clue 2. This could be a good move if I wanted to explore other areas first.
- Moving to (2,2) takes me away from the path to clue 2 and might require backtracking later on.
- Moving to (1,3) puts me out of order because it skips clue 2.

DECISION:
The best move is to go directly to clue 2 at position (1,0). This keeps the puzzle progression linear and follows the ascending order of clues. It also allows for the most straightforward path forward.

THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 12:55:43,324 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2), and my current situation is that I need to visit all the remaining clues in ascending order after visiting clue 6, which is located at (1,3). My goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path.

STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit clue 7, but since it's not provided in the available moves, I will consider visiting the next closest clue. Clue 8 is also not present among the options, so I will focus on moving towards the lower-right part of the board to get closer to clue 5 and clue 6.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* (0,2): This move takes me two rows up but doesn't bring me any closer to clue 5 or clue 6. It might help me avoid revisiting cells in the top-left part of the board.
* (2,2): Moving down one row and staying in the same column could help me get closer to clue 4 and might also open up possibilities for future moves.
* (1,3): This move takes me directly towards clue 6 but would block any potential path that requires visiting cells between my current position and clue 5.

DECISION:
Considering the options, moving down one row and staying in the same column at (2,2) seems like a good choice because it brings me closer to clue 4 and doesn't block any paths. However, since clue 6 is located at (1,3), visiting that clue would be more efficient if I could make my way there safely.

Considering the pros and cons of each move, I choose the middle option:

I have two main tasks: visiting the next clue number and navigating through the board to connect all clues. The closest unvisited clue to me is Clue 5 at position (1,4), but since it's not connected yet, I need to find a path that leads me there or consider other options.

Strategy:
Considering my current position, the available moves, and the goal of visiting the next clue number in ascending order, my next task is to decide which direction to take from (2,1). Since Clue 5 is at (1,4), I need to move towards it but also keep an eye on connecting with other clues.

Evaluation:
From (2,1), available moves include:

* Moving down: (3,1) or (4,1)
* Moving left: (2,0)
* Moving up: (1,1) or (0,1)

Pros and Cons of each move:

- **(3,1)**: This move gets me closer to Clue 5 at (1,4), but it might block potential paths if I need to backtrack.
- **(4,1)**: Similar to the previous option; this move takes me further away from some clues and doesn't seem optimal for connecting other clues directly.
- **(2,0)**: Moving left gets me closer to Clue 3 at (0,1), which could be useful but might not lead directly to Clue 5.
- **(1,1)**: This move is a viable option as it gets me to the first row without blocking potential paths and keeps me relatively central on the board. However, it doesn't directly contribute to reaching Clue 5.

Decision:
Given my analysis, moving up to (1,1) seems like the most reasonable choice at this point because it:

1. Keeps me in a central location.
2. Doesn’t block any potential future paths.
3. Prepares me for connecting other clues more efficiently.
4. Sets the stage for potentially reaching Clue 5 through additional moves.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 12:56:19,584 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,1), and I have filled 10 out of 25 cells. I need to continue my path in ascending order and visit all clue numbers from 4 onwards. My current situation is that I'm stuck with no available next moves. However, looking closer at the board, I realize that I can try to find a way to move further by exploring adjacent empty cells.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 5, which is located at position (1,4). From my current position, this seems like an attractive option because it moves me towards the top right corner of the board and gets me closer to the higher-numbered clues. However, before heading directly to Clue 5, I should consider whether there are any intermediate clues or paths that would be more beneficial.

3. EVALUATION:
For each available move from my current position (2,1), I can consider the following options:

* Move up: This gets me closer to the top row but doesn't immediately take me towards Clue 5.
* Move right: This is a potential way to get closer to Clue 5, but it might also block future paths or create difficulties in reaching other clues.
* Other moves: Since I'm at position (2,1), any move that's not up or right would likely take me away from the path and towards previously visited cells.

EVALUATION PROS AND CONS:

* Up: (+) gets closer to top row; (-) doesn't immediately help with Clue 5
* Right: (+) moves closer to Clue 5; (-) might block future paths or create difficulties

4. DECISION:
Based on the evaluation, moving right seems like a more promising option because it takes me closer to Clue 5. However, I need to carefully consider whether this move would indeed be beneficial in the long run.

DECISION REASONING:
I will choose to move right from position (2,1) towards position (2,2), which is currently blocked by a clue number "9". Since moving right is the only viable option that doesn't take me away from the path, I'll proceed with this move. This might allow me to make progress and find an optimal route to reach Clue 5 and subsequent clues.

I am currently at position (2,1) with a filled path of 10/25 cells. I need to visit the next higher numbered clue after Clue 6. The highest remaining clue not visited yet is Clue 7, but its location isn't specified in the current state. However, there's no available move from the given options, indicating that my current position might be blocked or limited.

Given this situation, I should consider moving towards the next potential clue based on the board layout and path history. The clues already visited are Clue 1 (4,2), Clue 2 (1,0), Clue 3 (0,1), and Clue 6 is at (1,3). Since Clue 7's location isn't specified but its visitation order follows the current state, I'll aim for moving towards the area of the board where it could logically be placed considering the path history.

Since there are no available moves explicitly listed, I have to deduce a potential next move based on logic. Considering my path so far and looking at the empty spaces around Clue 6 (1,3), if I aim for an adjacent cell towards the lower-left direction from Clue 6 or try to extend in a way that keeps options open for later moves, it makes sense to attempt moving into the available space next to where the path could potentially unfold further.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 12:56:37,037 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled only 1 out of 25 cells. I need to visit all clues in ascending order, starting with clue 2, which is located at position (4,2). From my current position, the available next moves are: (1,2), (0,1), or (0,3).

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue 2. Since it's already at a higher y-coordinate than my current position, I need to move down and then left or right to reach it.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* **Move (1,2)**: Pros: Moves me one row down. Cons: Still not closer to clue 2.
* **Move (0,1)**: Pros: Moves me one column to the left. Cons: Doesn't bring me closer to clue 2 or other clues in ascending order.
* **Move (0,3)**: Pros: Moves me one column to the right. Cons: Also doesn't bring me closer to clue 2.

DECISION:
Since moving down is a necessary step towards reaching clue 2, I will choose the move that gets me closer to it while also considering future paths. The optimal choice would be to move (1,2), which brings me one row down and opens up possibilities for further movement.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,2) and have filled only 1 out of 25 cells. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in a continuous path.
2. STRATEGY: The next clue to visit is number 2, which is located at position (4,2). However, before visiting the highest numbered clue directly, we need to ensure that all other clues are visited in ascending order and filled in between them with empty cells as needed.
3. EVALUATION:

   - **Move to (1,2)**: This would put me next to Clue 2 but doesn't allow me to reach it immediately since I have to follow the ascending order of clue numbers.

   - **Move to (0,1)**: Moving horizontally to the left would not bring me closer to any higher-numbered clues and could potentially isolate Clue 3, which is next in the order.

   - **Move to (0,3)**: Similar to moving to the left, this move doesn't bring us closer to our immediate objective of visiting clue numbers in ascending order. It's also away from a potential path that could lead directly to higher-numbered clues after Clue 2 is visited.

4. DECISION:
Considering my current position and the need to visit all clues in ascending order, moving to (0,1) seems like the best initial move. This allows us to progress horizontally towards the clue locations while keeping an eye on maintaining a path that adheres to the rules of visiting all cells exactly once.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1), and I have already filled 2 out of 25 cells. My path so far is (0,2) -> (0,1). According to the puzzle rules, I need to visit every clue number in ascending order. The current clue numbers I've visited are 1 (at position (0,2)).

2. STRATEGY:
Next, I should visit Clue 2, which is located at position (4,2). However, since I can only move horizontally or vertically and need to fill empty cells between clues as needed, I may not necessarily start moving directly towards (4,2) right away. My priority is still to explore the surrounding area and find the most efficient path.

3. EVALUATION:
Available next moves are (1,1) and (0,0). For each move:

- (1,1): This move gets me closer to Clue 3 at position (1,1), which I need to visit eventually as part of my ascending order requirement. It also opens up new pathways to explore towards the bottom-right corner where Clue 2 is located.
  
- (0,0): Moving here doesn't immediately progress any clue numbers but could potentially allow me more flexibility in moving vertically towards Clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Considering my need to visit all clues in ascending order and knowing that I have already visited Clue 1 at position (0,2), the next logical step is to move towards the area of Clue 3 while also keeping options open for future paths. Between (0,0) and (1,1), moving to (1,1) gets me closer to a clue in ascending order and sets up more efficient paths forward.

2025-12-10 12:57:08,630 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (1,1), which means I have visited Clue 3 as per the path taken: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1). My current situation is that I need to continue visiting clue numbers in ascending order. Since I've already visited Clue 3, my next target should be Clue 4.

**STRATEGY:** The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 4. However, there's no direct mention of its location in the provided information. Given that the clues are located at specific positions and we have to fill all cells between them, I will assume that the correct sequence should lead me towards higher-numbered clues. Therefore, my next target should be Clue 4.

**EVALUATION:**

- **Available Move (2,1):** Moving up would put me in a position closer to potentially being able to reach the upper part of the board more efficiently but does not directly address visiting Clue 4.
  
- **Available Move (1,0):** Moving left does not help with reaching any higher-numbered clue directly and would essentially back me into an area where I'd have to navigate around a potential path for future clues.

- **Available Move (1,2):** This move is actually not listed among the available choices but considering my need to visit Clue 4 next, moving right could potentially allow for easier navigation towards higher-numbered clues or at least give me room to explore. However, I must choose from the options provided which do not include this.

Considering the given moves and aiming to reach the highest possible clue position efficiently:

**DECISION:** The best move among the available choices is (1,0), as it allows for more exploration space and doesn't force a specific path that might lead away from higher-numbered clues. However, ideally, I would prefer to move towards a direction or position that's likely to lead me closer to Clue 4, but between the given options, moving left is the safer choice to explore and possibly backtrack if needed.

I am currently at position (1,0), which means I'm in the second row and first column of the grid. The path taken so far is (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0). This indicates that I've visited clue 3 already.

Looking at the current game state, I have a few available moves: (0,0) and (2,0). Since my goal is to visit all clues in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue, which is clue 5, I need to plan my next move carefully.

Next, I should aim to visit clue 4, which is located at position (3,1) or somewhere near it. However, since the available moves are limited to (0,0) and (2,0), I'll evaluate each option separately.

EVALUATION:
- **Move to (0,0)**: This would be a backward move, taking me away from the current path. It might block some potential paths or create a dead-end if I don't visit clue 4 soon.
  
- **Move to (2,0)**: This option seems more promising as it allows me to potentially find a direct route to clue 4.

STRATEGY:
Since I'm currently at position (1,0) and need to visit all clues in ascending order, the next clue after 3 would be clue 4. Clue 4's location is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the legend of the puzzle, we know that a path will lead to it. 

DECISION:
Given these considerations, I think moving to (2,0) is the best option for now. It allows me to potentially move forward and find a direct route to clue 4 without blocking any future paths.

2025-12-10 12:57:28,601 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,0), which means I'm on the third row and first column of the board. According to the path taken so far, I have visited clues 1 and 3 in ascending order. Now, my current position is two cells away from clue 3.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number to visit is indeed clue 4. However, since it's not directly adjacent to me, I need to plan my path accordingly. Clue 4 is located at position (3,1), but there are no other clues in the first column of the third row that we should prioritize.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
   a) Move to (3,0): This would take me horizontally one cell away from my current position. However, it doesn't get me any closer to clue 4 or provide an advantage over moving vertically.
   
   b) Move to (2,1): This move gets me diagonally but also moves me in the right direction towards clues higher up in value, although it's not a direct path towards clue 4.

4. DECISION: Considering my current position and available moves, neither of them seems directly advantageous for visiting clue 4 immediately. Given that I'm on the third row and want to maintain an ascending order, I should aim to get closer to the higher-numbered clues first. Moving up is generally a better option since it allows me more flexibility for future paths. Thus, moving to (2,1) seems like the best choice because it maintains my vertical momentum without blocking any potential paths.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 12:57:43,925 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,1), and my path has been: (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1). There are 6 filled cells out of a total of 25.

2. STRATEGY: My next goal is to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (1,1), where I am currently sitting! However, since I've already visited this clue, my next target should be the highest numbered clue that hasn't been visited yet, which is either not among the options or I need to follow the ascending order. Since we're in a 5x5 grid and following the ascending order of clues (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...), Clue 4 at position (3,0) comes next.

However, considering the given available next moves are (3,1) and (2,2), it seems I should prioritize visiting the next clue after (1,1). Since we're on a grid with ascending order, let's check if there is any other clue that hasn't been mentioned yet: Clue 2 at position (4,2) has been visited but not in sequence; hence, let's look for the highest unvisited one. Given the rules and my current situation, I should proceed to visit Clues following the ascending order after visiting (1,1).

3. EVALUATION:
- Option 1: Move to (2,2)
  - Pros: Allows me to move horizontally or vertically from here.
  - Cons: Doesn't get closer to any clue directly; might not fit well with the ascending clue visitation sequence.

- Option 2: Move to (3,1)
  - Pros: Gets me slightly closer to Clue 4 but doesn't align perfectly with the clues' ascending order we must follow.
  - Cons: The move to (3,1) would be out of sequence for visiting the highest clue first if not done strategically.

- Considering my immediate next goal is following the ascending order and since I'm at a position where the next logical step could lead me towards Clue 4 or continuing the ascending order by not deviating too much from it.

4. DECISION: 
Given that we are in a path-finding puzzle with an emphasis on visiting each clue in ascending order, the best move seems to be (3,1) as it aligns slightly better with the sequence when considering my next immediate goal after (1,1). It also doesn't block any direct paths but is more about following the sequence than being directly at a clue.

MOVE: (3,1)

However, revisiting the clues and their order to ensure I'm not missing something crucial or misunderstanding the puzzle's logic is essential.

2025-12-10 12:57:59,408 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,1), which means I'm in the third row and first column of the grid. According to the visual board state, I have filled 7 out of 25 cells so far. My path taken is (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1).

2. STRATEGY: The next clue I need to visit is Clue 4, which is not provided in the clue locations. However, it's mentioned that we have a total of 25 cells and clues are numbered from 1 to the highest number. Since there are only three clues given (1, 2, and 3), the next clue must be at position (0,4). Therefore, I should aim for visiting this position.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
	* Moving to (4,1) would get me closer to Clue 4 but might not necessarily be the most efficient path.
	* Moving to (3,0) would take me in a slightly different direction and does not seem directly beneficial for reaching Clue 4 quickly.
	* Moving to (3,2) is an attempt to go around and reach Clue 4 more efficiently.

However, given the visual board state and the clues provided, I should be aiming for the next clue that hasn't been mentioned yet. Since it's implied we need to visit all cells in ascending order after the last mentioned clue (Clue 3), we actually are aiming for the first empty space that leads us towards Clue 4 logically.

Considering this logic and the board state, I realize that my previous understanding was incorrect regarding moving towards an unseen Clue 4 directly. The correct next step is to follow the ascending order of clues as provided (1 -> 2 -> 3), and since we are at position (3,1) after visiting clues up to Clue 3, our next logical step should be to revisit a clue or fill empty cells in such a way that respects the ascending order.

Given this correction:
- Since my current path has already visited clues up to 3, the next move logically is not directly aiming for an unseen future clue but rather ensuring we adhere to the given puzzle rules and strategy.

Upon reevaluation, considering we need to fill empty cells between clues as needed and respect the ascending order:

The logical step after visiting Clue 3 should be to revisit a clue or proceed in a way that fills these gaps correctly. Since there is an available move towards (4,2), which is the location of Clue 2, this seems like a direct continuation of the path, ensuring we visit all clues in ascending order without skipping any.

Therefore:

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (3,0), and my current situation is that I need to visit all the remaining clues in ascending order. The last clue I visited was 3, so I need to go to clue 4 next. However, before doing that, I should try to clear up some of the empty cells between the existing path.

2. STRATEGY: Clue number 4 is located at position (0,1). Since it's a small board size and there are many empty spaces, I'll prioritize exploring nearby regions and possibly connecting existing paths before heading towards clue 4.

3. EVALUATION:
   - Available move 1: Move to (4,0)
     Pros: This move doesn't block any potential future moves; Cons: It might not directly lead me closer to a specific clue.
   - Available move 2: Other options seem limited since moving to (0,0) or in the row above would require revisiting cells and isn’t allowed.

4. DECISION:
Considering the available next moves, I'll choose to stay within the board and ensure that my path is efficient while avoiding revisiting any spaces. Given this scenario, the best move seems to be the only option: moving to (4,0).

I am currently at position (4,0) and have filled 9 out of 25 cells. Looking at the board, I can see that I've visited clues 1 and 3, which means clue 2 is next in order. Clue 2 is located at position (4,2). From my current position, I can move to (4,1) as per the available moves.

STRATEGY:
I should visit clue 2 next, but since it's already filled and not empty, I need to find a path that allows me to reach it in ascending order. Therefore, I don't necessarily have to go directly to clue 2 at position (4,2).

EVALUATION:
For each available move, the pros and cons are:

* Move to (4,1): This move is already provided as an option and seems like a logical step, allowing me to potentially fill empty cells on the way to future clues.
* Other possible moves would involve backtracking or going out of order.

DECISION:
Based on my current situation and the need to visit clue 2 in ascending order, I should choose the available next move.

2025-12-10 12:58:29,760 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,1), and according to the current game state, I have filled 10 out of 25 cells. Looking at the available next moves, my goal is to visit clue 2, which is located at position (4,2). However, I can only move horizontally or vertically, and there's a higher numbered clue nearby.

STRATEGY:
Since my task is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path while visiting all clues in ascending order, the next step would be to visit clue 2. It's strategically important because it allows me to reach the highest numbered clue efficiently.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (4,3) and (4,0). 

Pros of moving to (4,3):
- I'll be closer to the next possible move, potentially leading to fewer moves in the future.
- Moving right might open up new paths or lead me towards higher numbered clues.

Cons:
- I'm not directly reaching clue 2; it's still one move away.

Pros of moving to (4,0):
- This would take me one step closer to clue 2.

Cons:
- Moving left doesn't necessarily advance the path toward higher-numbered clues as effectively as moving right could in other scenarios.

DECISION:
Given that my current position is (4,1) and I'm aiming for a continuous path while visiting all clues, moving left directly to clue 2 would be the most straightforward choice at this juncture. It ensures I stay on track with ascending order and minimizes the risk of backtracking or missing out on cells.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (4,1), which is one row above and one column to the left of clue number 2, and I have already visited clue 1. From my current path, I can see that I've been moving downwards, trying to reach the top-right corner where all the clues are located. Now, I need to decide what to do next.

STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue 3, which is located at position (1,1). This will help me move towards the center of the board and eventually get closer to clue number 4 and higher.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (4,2) is directly above my current position. I can move there, but it's not a necessary step since it doesn't bring me any closer to my goal. Alternatively, I could move (3,0), which gets me one row below and directly adjacent to clue number 3.

MOVE:
Since moving to (4,2) is unnecessary and moving down to (3,0) brings me directly adjacent to the next clue, I will choose the latter.

2025-12-10 12:58:56,154 - LLM_configuration.llm_manager - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (4,1) and have filled 10 out of 25 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at position (1,1). However, my current position is already on top of the clue location. Therefore, I will need to choose a move that gets me closer to clue 3.

My goal is to fill all 25 cells in one continuous path and end at the highest numbered clue, which is currently clue 3. I should aim to visit clues in ascending order, but since clue 3's position is not far from my current location, I can focus on getting there efficiently.

EVALUATION:
The available next moves are (4,2), but this would take me away from the intended path towards clue 3. Since (4,2) is a valid move according to the rules and doesn't block any future paths, I should consider it as an option.

However, since my current position is not on top of clue 3's location and I need to visit clues in ascending order, visiting another clue first might be beneficial. The puzzle does not specify how to treat tied positions for multiple clues, so we will have to follow the given rules and instructions provided by the puzzle creator.

DECISION:
Considering all factors and available information, I should choose a move that gets me closer to clue 3 while also considering visiting other clues in ascending order.

Since clue locations are specified and following the path taken thus far, it is logical to continue exploring the most direct route to clue 3. However, without additional options, the best choice given my current position (4,1) would be to move towards a location that aligns with this goal of visiting clue 3 first while also considering the puzzle's constraints.

However, since we only have one next possible move according to our analysis and no other options were listed as available next moves besides (4,2), it seems more likely that we are meant to explore how we could utilize any empty space or clues in between our current position and clue 3. But given the board's constraints and the requirement for visiting all cells exactly once, this might not be directly applicable here.

MOVE: 
Considering these factors, I should select a move based on getting closer to clue 3 while also considering other puzzle objectives and constraints.

Given that (4,2) is an available next move but doesn't seem to align with our goal of reaching the next clue in ascending order efficiently from my current position, another logical step would be needed if we were given more options. 

Since no further steps are provided by the puzzle for us to explore and only one potential choice is presented despite our analysis suggesting that moving towards a more direct route or considering other clues first might make sense, I'm left to conclude based on available information.

Given these limitations, it's difficult to determine an optimal move directly from my current position without revisiting previous steps. 

However, if we assume the provided next moves as correct and utilize the puzzle instructions for guidance, moving towards (4,2) or exploring options around clue 3 might be more beneficial based on ascending order but lacks clear direction with no other options to choose between.

MOVE: 
Given that my analysis above suggests an optimal route should prioritize visiting clue 3 but acknowledges limitations in the provided next moves and given instructions for puzzle progression, I will select a move based on potential future steps and the logic of solving the puzzle. 

In this case, since we have limited information to work with here and cannot directly optimize towards clue 3 without additional options or more precise guidance from previous puzzle states or available board positions beyond what is presented.
