Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
   - Current position: (0,0)
   - Cells filled: 5/9
   - Path so far: (2,2) [clue 1] -> (2,1) [clue 2] -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0)
   - I've already visited clues 1 and 2 in order
   - Next clue to visit: Clue 3 at position (0,2)
   - Remaining empty cells: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (0,2)
   - Total cells remaining to fill: 4 cells

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
   - I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at (0,2)
   - Since clue 3 is the highest numbered clue, I must END my path there
   - This means I need to visit all remaining empty cells BEFORE reaching (0,2)
   - Remaining cells to visit before clue 3: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)
   - Then finally end at (0,2)

3. EVALUATION: For each available move
   - Only one move available from (0,0): (0,1)
   
   Let me trace if this works:
   - From (0,0) -> (0,1): This moves me horizontally toward clue 3
   - From (0,1), I could go to (0,2) [clue 3], but that would be premature - I still have (1,1) and (1,2) unvisited
   - From (0,1), I could go to (1,1) instead
   - From (1,1) -> (1,2)
   - From (1,2) -> (0,2) [clue 3] - END
   
   This path would be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)
   That's 4 more moves, filling all remaining cells and ending at clue 3. Perfect!

4. DECISION:
   - Move to (0,1) is the only available move and it works perfectly
   - It allows me to visit all remaining cells and end at clue 3 as required

   - Only one move available from (0,0): (0,1)
   
   Let me trace if this works:
   - From (0,0) -> (0,1): This moves me horizontally toward clue 3
   - From (0,1), I could go to (0,2) [clue 3], but that would be premature - I still have (1,1) and (1,2) unvisited
   - From (0,1), I could go to (1,1) instead
   - From (1,1) -> (1,2)
   - From (1,2) -> (0,2) [clue 3] - END
   
   This path would be: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)
   That's 4 more moves, filling all remaining cells and ending at clue 3. Perfect!

4. DECISION:
   - Move to (0,1) is the only available move and it works perfectly
   - It allows me to visit all remaining cells and end at clue 3 as required

2025-12-10 13:48:05,884 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- I am currently at position (1,2)
- I have filled 8 out of 9 cells
- Only 1 cell remains empty: (0,2)
- My path so far: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)
- I've already visited clues 1 (at 2,2) and 2 (at 2,1)
- Clue 3 is at position (0,2), which is the only remaining empty cell

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
- I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at position (0,2)
- According to the rules, I must visit all clues in ascending order and end at the highest numbered clue
- Clue 3 is the highest numbered clue, so this should be my final move

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- There is only ONE available move: (0,2)
- From (1,2), I can move to (0,2) which is directly above me
- Pros: 
  * This is the only empty cell left
  * It contains clue 3, which I need to visit next
  * It completes the puzzle (9/9 cells filled)
  * It ends at the highest numbered clue as required
- Cons: None - this is the only legal move and it satisfies all puzzle requirements

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (0,2) is the only available move and it's the correct move
- It visits clue 3 (the next required clue in sequence)
- It completes the path by filling the final cell
- It ends at the highest numbered clue (clue 3) as required by the rules

2025-12-10 13:48:21,757 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (1,1), which is clue 1. I have filled 1 out of 9 cells. Since this is a 3x3 grid, I need to visit all 9 cells exactly once. Looking at the board, I can see there are no other numbered clues visible besides the starting clue 1 at my current position. This means I need to create a path that visits all 9 cells in one continuous route.

2. STRATEGY:
Since there's only clue 1 visible on the board, my goal is to create a Hamiltonian path (visiting every cell exactly once) starting from (1,1). I need to ensure my path doesn't trap me in a corner or create a situation where I can't reach all remaining cells.

3. EVALUATION of available moves:
- **(0,1) - UP**: This moves to the top middle cell. From there, I could continue to corners and edges. This is a relatively safe move as the middle top position has good connectivity.
  
- **(2,1) - DOWN**: This moves to the bottom middle cell. Similar to moving up, this maintains central positioning and good access to remaining cells.

- **(1,0) - LEFT**: This moves to the middle left cell. This is an edge position but still maintains reasonable access to other cells.

- **(1,2) - RIGHT**: This moves to the middle right cell. Also an edge position with reasonable connectivity.

For a 3x3 grid starting from the center, a common successful pattern is to move to an edge or corner and then snake through the grid. Moving to a middle edge position (up, down, left, or right) allows me to then move to a corner and create a systematic path.

4. DECISION:
I'll move to **(0,1) - UP**. This takes me to the top middle position. From there, I can move to (0,0) or (0,2) to reach a corner, then snake through the remaining cells systematically. This approach minimizes the risk of getting trapped and ensures I can visit all 9 cells.

- **(1,0) - LEFT**: This moves to the middle left cell. This is an edge position but still maintains reasonable access to other cells.

- **(1,2) - RIGHT**: This moves to the middle right cell. Also an edge position with reasonable connectivity.

For a 3x3 grid starting from the center, a common successful pattern is to move to an edge or corner and then snake through the grid. Moving to a middle edge position (up, down, left, or right) allows me to then move to a corner and create a systematic path.

4. DECISION:
I'll move to **(0,1) - UP**. This takes me to the top middle position. From there, I can move to (0,0) or (0,2) to reach a corner, then snake through the remaining cells systematically. This approach minimizes the risk of getting trapped and ensures I can visit all 9 cells.

2025-12-10 13:48:53,983 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

1. ANALYSIS - Current Situation:
   - I'm at position (0,0) having filled 3/9 cells
   - Path so far: (1,1) [clue 1] -> (0,1) -> (0,0)
   - I started at clue 1 as required
   - There are no other numbered clues visible on the board (only clue 1 exists)
   - I need to fill all 9 cells in one continuous path
   - Only one move available: (1,0)

2. STRATEGY - What's Next:
   - Since clue 1 at (1,1) is the only clue, I just need to create a continuous path visiting all 9 cells
   - I must end somewhere after visiting all cells
   - From (0,0), I can only move to (1,0) (the only available move listed)

3. EVALUATION - Available Move:
   - Move to (1,0): This is the only option given
     * PROS: Continues the path downward, keeps me connected
     * CONS: I need to ensure I can still reach all remaining 6 cells: (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), and (0,2)
   
   Let me trace if this works:
   - Current: (0,0)
   - Move to (1,0) - cell 4
   - From (1,0), I could go to (2,0) - cell 5
   - From (2,0), I could go to (2,1) - cell 6
   - From (2,1), I could go to (2,2) - cell 7
   - From (2,2), I could go to (1,2) - cell 8
   - From (1,2), I could go to (0,2) - cell 9
   
   This path would visit all 9 cells without revisiting any!

4. DECISION:
   Moving to (1,0) is the only available option and it allows me to complete a valid path through all remaining cells.

- Remaining empty cells: (0,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) - that's 4 cells
- I've already visited the only clue (clue 1 at position (1,1))
- Since there's only one clue, I just need to fill all remaining cells in a valid path

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
- There is only clue 1, which I've already visited at the start
- My goal now is to visit all remaining 4 empty cells: (0,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)
- I need to ensure I can reach all of them without getting trapped

- Available move: (2,1) - this is the only adjacent cell I can move to from (2,0)

Let me check if moving to (2,1) allows me to complete the puzzle:
- From (2,0), I move to (2,1)
- From (2,1), I can move to (2,2) or (1,1) - but (1,1) is already visited, so I must go to (2,2)
- From (2,2), I can move to (1,2) or back to (2,1) - but (2,1) would be visited, so I go to (1,2)
- From (1,2), I can move to (0,2) or (1,1) or (2,2) - but (1,1) and (2,2) are visited, so I go to (0,2)
- This completes all 9 cells!

Path would be: (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (2,1) is the only available move, and it leads to a valid solution that visits all 9 cells
- This move allows me to complete the bottom row, then work my way up the right column to fill all remaining cells

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:49:47,965 - INFO - THINKING:

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- Current position: (2,2)
- Progress: 7/9 cells filled
- Path taken: (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)
- Remaining empty cells: (0,2) and (1,2)
- I started at clue 1 which was at position (1,1)
- There appears to be only one clue (clue 1) on this board

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
- I've already visited clue 1 (it was my starting position at (1,1))
- Looking at the board, I don't see any other numbered clues mentioned in the clue locations
- Since there's only clue 1, I've already visited all clues
- My goal now is to complete the path by visiting all remaining cells

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Available next move: (1,2)
- From (2,2), I can only move to (1,2) or (2,1)
- (2,1) has already been visited (it was step 6 in my path)
- (1,2) is unvisited and is one of the two remaining empty cells
- After moving to (1,2), I would have one cell left: (0,2)
- From (1,2), I can reach (0,2) by moving up, which would complete the puzzle (9/9 cells)

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (1,2) is the only valid move available
- This move allows me to continue toward completing all 9 cells
- From (1,2), I can reach the final cell (0,2) to complete the puzzle
- This creates a valid continuous path visiting all cells exactly once

MOVE: (1,2)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

   - Current position: (0,2)
   - Progress: 9/9 cells filled
   - The puzzle indicates "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)"
   - Looking at the path taken: (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)
   - All 9 cells have been visited exactly once
   - The path started at clue 1 located at (1,1)

2. STRATEGY:
   - Wait, let me check if this puzzle is actually complete or if there's an error
   - There is only ONE clue given: Clue 1 at position (1,1)
   - The path started at (1,1) as required (clue 1)
   - All 9 cells have been filled in a continuous path
   - Since there's only clue 1, and we started there, we've visited all clues in order
   - The path is complete!

3. EVALUATION:
   - The puzzle state shows 9/9 cells filled
   - The path is continuous (each move is horizontal or vertical)
   - No cell has been revisited
   - Started at clue 1 (the only clue)
   - The message "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)" is actually indicating completion, not failure

4. DECISION:
   - This puzzle is COMPLETE! 
   - There are no more moves to make because all cells have been visited
   - The path successfully covers all 9 cells starting from clue 1
   - Since there's only one clue and we started there, all clue requirements are satisfied

The puzzle has been successfully solved. The path visits every cell exactly once, starts at clue 1, and forms a valid continuous path.

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (0,2), which is clue 1. I have filled 1/9 cells. I need to visit all 9 cells in the 3x3 grid, visiting clue 2 at position (1,2) before ending at the highest clue.

2. STRATEGY:
My next target is clue 2, which is located at position (1,2). This is directly below my current position. Since I must visit clue 2 next and it's one of my available moves, this seems like the obvious choice.

3. EVALUATION:
- Move to (1,2): This is clue 2, my next required destination. This would fulfill the requirement of visiting clues in order. From (1,2), I would have visited 2/9 cells and could continue exploring the board.
  
- Move to (0,1): This moves left along the top row. While this is a valid move, it takes me away from clue 2. I would then need to navigate back to reach (1,2) eventually. However, since I MUST visit clue 2 next (as per rule 3), and I can reach it directly, delaying this visit could create path complications later.

4. DECISION:
The best move is (1,2) because:
- It's clue 2, which I must visit next according to the rules
- It's directly accessible from my current position
- Moving there keeps my options open for completing the remaining 7 cells
- Delaying the visit to clue 2 by going to (0,1) first could potentially create a situation where I block myself from reaching clue 2 or completing the full path

2025-12-10 13:51:17,448 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (1,2), which is clue 2. I have filled 2 out of 9 cells so far. My path has been: (0,2) [clue 1] -> (1,2) [clue 2]. I have 7 more cells to fill to complete the puzzle.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
I've visited clues 1 and 2. Since there are only 2 clues given in this puzzle, I don't have any more mandatory clue numbers to visit. My goal now is to fill all remaining 7 cells in a continuous path without revisiting any cell, and I must end at clue 2 (the highest numbered clue). Wait - I'm already AT clue 2, so I need to continue from here and eventually return to end at this position... No, that's wrong. Let me re-read the rules.

Actually, rule 4 says "End your path at the highest numbered clue." Since clue 2 is the highest and I'm already there at step 2, this seems problematic. Let me reconsider...

Oh! I see the issue. I need to visit ALL 9 cells, and clue 2 should be the LAST cell I visit (cell #9 in my path). But I've already visited it as cell #2. This means my current path is incorrect, OR I'm misunderstanding the puzzle state.

Looking at the visual board again:
- Row 0: "2 . [1]" means clue 2 is at (0,0), empty at (0,1), and my first step [1] is at (0,2)
- Row 1: ". 4 [2]" means empty at (1,0), something at (1,1), and my second step [2] is at (1,2)

Wait, the "4" at position (1,1) - what does that mean? Let me check the legend... it's not in brackets, so it's not part of my path yet. But it's not listed as a clue either. This might be showing the step number that cell will be when I visit it, or it's an error.

Given the current state and available moves (2,2) and (1,1), I need to continue filling cells. Since I must visit all 9 cells and end at clue 2 (which is at position 1,2 where I currently am), this is impossible unless clue 2 is meant to be visited last.

Let me reconsider: Perhaps I need to create a path that visits all cells, and clue 2 at (1,2) should be the 9th and final cell. But I'm already there at step 2. This suggests the puzzle setup might have an error, OR I should continue and create the longest possible path.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
- Move to (2,2): This is a corner cell. Moving here keeps options open for continuing the path through (2,1) and (2,0).
- Move to (1,1): This is the center cell. Moving here gives access to multiple directions but might create path complications.

4. DECISION:
Given that I need to fill all 9 cells, I should choose the move that allows me to create the longest continuous path. Moving to (2,2) allows me to sweep through the bottom row, then work my way back up. This seems like a more systematic approach.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

- My path so far: (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0)

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
- I have already visited all the clues (clue 1 and clue 2)
- Since clue 2 is the highest numbered clue and I've already visited it, I just need to complete the path by filling the last remaining cell
- The puzzle requires visiting every cell exactly once, so I must move to the only remaining empty cell

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Available moves from (1,0): only (2,0) is available
- (2,0) is the only empty cell left on the board
- Moving to (2,0) will complete the puzzle by filling all 9 cells
- This is the only legal move available

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (2,0) is the only option and it completes the puzzle
- This move fills the last remaining cell, satisfying the requirement to visit every cell exactly once
- The path will be complete: all 9 cells visited in one continuous path

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 13:53:38,512 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,2), which is clue 1 (my starting point). I have filled 1 out of 9 cells. Looking at the board, I can see there are clues at:
- Clue 1 at (2,2) - where I am now
- Clue 2 at (0,0)
- Clue 3 at (0,2)
- Clue 4 at (1,1)

My available moves from (2,2) are: (1,2) and (2,1).

2. STRATEGY:
According to the rules, I must visit clues in ascending order. Since I'm at clue 1, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (0,0) - the top-left corner of the board.

3. EVALUATION:
Let me evaluate each available move:

**Move to (1,2):** 
- This moves me up one row to the right column
- From (1,2), I could continue to (0,2) which is clue 3, but I need to reach clue 2 at (0,0) first
- This move takes me toward the top of the board but in the wrong column
- I would need to navigate left to reach (0,0), which is possible

**Move to (2,1):**
- This moves me left one column in the bottom row
- From (2,1), I could move to (2,0), then up to (1,0), then to (0,0) - this creates a clear path to clue 2
- This move keeps more options open and creates a natural path along the left side toward clue 2
- This seems like a more direct route to reach (0,0)

4. DECISION:
Move to (2,1) is the better choice. It positions me on a clear path toward clue 2 at (0,0). From (2,1), I can continue left to (2,0), then move up the left column to eventually reach clue 2. This path also allows me to efficiently visit the remaining cells and clues in order.

2025-12-10 13:53:39,545 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (2,2)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 2/9 cells filled
Current Position: (2,1)
Path Taken: (2,2) -> (2,1)

Visual Board State:
  2    .    3 
  .    4    . 
  .  [ 2] [ 1]
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (1,1), (2,0)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:53:50,865 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (2,1), having started at clue 1 at position (2,2). I've filled 2 out of 9 cells, so I have 7 more cells to visit. Looking at the board, I can see:
- Clue 2 is at position (0,0)
- Clue 3 is at position (0,2)
- Clue 4 is at position (1,1)

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
Since I started at clue 1, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (0,0) - the top-left corner of the board.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Option A: Move to (1,1)
- This is where clue 4 is located
- CONS: I would be visiting clue 4 before clue 2, which violates the rule of visiting clues in ascending order (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4)
- This move would be invalid

Option B: Move to (2,0)
- This moves me to the bottom-left corner
- PROS: From (2,0), I can continue upward to (1,0) and then to (0,0) where clue 2 is located. This creates a valid path toward clue 2.
- PROS: This doesn't prematurely visit any clues out of order
- PROS: This allows me to approach clue 2 systematically while keeping other paths open
- No immediate blocking concerns

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
Move to (2,0) is the only valid choice. Moving to (1,1) would force me to visit clue 4 before clue 2, violating the ascending order rule. Moving to (2,0) keeps me on track to reach clue 2 at (0,0) by going up the left column.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- I am currently at position (1,2)
- I have filled 8 out of 9 cells
- Only 1 cell remains empty: (1,1)
- I started at clue 1 which was at position (2,2)
- My path so far: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2)

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
- Looking at the clue locations, there is only ONE clue mentioned: Clue 1 at position (2,2)
- Since I started at clue 1 (as required by rule 2), and there are no other clues listed (no clue 2, 3, etc.), this means clue 1 is both the starting AND ending point
- However, I've already visited (2,2) as my first move, so I cannot return there (rule 6: never revisit a cell)
- Wait, let me reconsider: The puzzle says "End your path at the highest numbered clue" - since there's only clue 1, and I started there, the puzzle structure is simply to visit all 9 cells in one continuous path

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Only one move is available: (1,1)
- This is the last remaining empty cell
- Moving to (1,1) will complete the puzzle by filling all 9 cells
- There are no other options, and this move doesn't violate any rules

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (1,1) is the only available move and it completes the puzzle
- This fills the final cell, satisfying rule 1 (visit every cell exactly once)
- The path remains continuous with only horizontal/vertical moves
- No cells are revisited

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (2,2), which is clue 1 (my starting point). I have filled 1 out of 9 cells. According to the rules, I must visit all clues in ascending order, so my next target is clue 2, which is located at position (1,1).

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (1,1). This is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but since I can only move horizontally or vertically, I need to take at least 2 moves to reach it.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Option A: Move to (1,2)
- This moves me one step closer to clue 2 at (1,1)
- From (1,2), I can reach (1,1) in one more move
- After visiting clue 2, I would have visited cells: (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1), leaving 6 cells to fill
- The remaining cells would be: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1)
- This seems manageable as I can create a continuous path

Option B: Move to (2,1)
- This also moves me one step closer to clue 2 at (1,1)
- From (2,1), I can reach (1,1) in one more move
- After visiting clue 2, I would have visited cells: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1), leaving 6 cells to fill
- The remaining cells would be: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0)
- This also seems manageable

Both options get me to clue 2 in the same number of moves. Let me think about which leaves a better path for filling all remaining cells after reaching clue 2.

If I go (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1), from (1,1) I can continue to (0,1), (1,0), or (2,1). This gives me flexibility.

If I go (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1), from (1,1) I can continue to (0,1), (1,0), or (1,2). This also gives me flexibility.

Both seem equally viable. Let me choose (1,2) as it keeps the bottom-right corner connected and allows for a natural flow upward.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
I'll choose (1,2) because it moves me toward clue 2 and maintains good connectivity for completing the remaining path after visiting clue 2.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:56:09,573 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (1,1), which is clue 2. I have filled 3 out of 9 cells so far. My path has been: (2,2) [clue 1] -> (1,2) -> (1,1) [clue 2]. Since I've visited both clues (1 and 2 in order), I now need to fill the remaining 6 empty cells to complete the puzzle. The empty cells are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), and (2,1).

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all numbered clues (1 and 2), my goal now is to create a continuous path that visits all remaining 6 empty cells exactly once. I need to ensure I don't create a path that traps me or leaves cells unreachable.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (1,1):
- (0,1): Moving up to the middle of the top row. This gives me access to (0,0) and (0,2), and I could continue the path along the top row.
- (2,1): Moving down to the middle of the bottom row. This gives me access to (2,0), and I could work along the bottom row.
- (1,0): Moving left to the middle of the left column. This gives me access to (0,0) and (2,0).

Let me think about which creates the best path:
- If I go to (0,1), I can go to (0,0), then (1,0), then (2,0), then (2,1), then (0,2)... wait, I can't reach (0,2) from (2,1).
- If I go to (0,1), I can go to (0,2), then... I'd be stuck in a corner with no way to reach the remaining cells efficiently.
- If I go to (1,0), I can go to (0,0), then (0,1), then (0,2), then back down... but (0,2) only connects to (0,1), so I'd need to plan carefully.
- If I go to (2,1), I can go to (2,0), then (1,0), then (0,0), then (0,1), then (0,2). That's 6 moves total, which is exactly what I need!

Let me verify the path from (2,1): (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2). That's 6 additional cells, giving me 9 total. Perfect!

4. DECISION:
Moving to (2,1) allows me to create a clean path that sweeps through the bottom row, up the left column, and across the top row, visiting all remaining cells without getting trapped.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- Current position: (0,1)
- Progress: 8/9 cells filled
- Only 1 cell remains empty: (0,2)
- I've already visited clues 1 and 2 in the correct order (started at clue 1 at (2,2), then visited clue 2 at (1,1))
- My path so far: (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1)

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
- I've already visited all the clues (1 and 2)
- Clue 2 at (1,1) was the highest numbered clue, and I visited it as step 3 in my path
- Since there are no more clues to visit, I just need to complete the path by filling the last remaining cell

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Only one move is available: (0,2)
- This is the only empty cell left on the board
- Moving to (0,2) will complete the puzzle by visiting all 9 cells exactly once
- This move is valid (horizontal movement from (0,1) to (0,2))
- No cons - this is the only option and it completes the puzzle

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (0,2) is the only available move and the correct move
- It fills the last remaining cell, completing the requirement to visit every cell exactly once
- The path remains continuous and valid throughout

1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 13:58:18,718 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,0), which is clue 1 (the starting point). I have filled 1 out of 9 cells. According to the rules, I must visit all clues in ascending order, so my next target is clue 2, which is located at position (2,1) - directly to my right.

2. STRATEGY:
My next mandatory destination is clue 2 at position (2,1). Since I must visit every cell exactly once and create one continuous path through all 9 cells, I need to plan carefully to avoid trapping myself.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (2,0):
- **(1,0)**: Moving up to (1,0) would take me away from clue 2. This could be part of a longer path, but let me check if it's viable. If I go up first, I'd need to eventually come back down to reach clue 2 at (2,1). This would require visiting other cells first and could create a more complex path.
  
- **(2,1)**: Moving right to (2,1) takes me directly to clue 2, which is my next required destination. This is the most direct route and satisfies the requirement of visiting clues in order.

Let me verify the path viability:
- If I move to (2,1) now, I'll have visited the bottom-left corner and bottom-middle. From (2,1), I can continue to (2,2) or (1,1), giving me flexibility to complete the remaining 7 cells.
- If I move to (1,0) first, I'd be delaying reaching clue 2, and I'd need to ensure I can still reach it while visiting all cells exactly once.

4. DECISION:
Moving to (2,1) is the optimal choice because:
- It directly fulfills the requirement of visiting clue 2 next
- It maintains path continuity
- It leaves me with good options to continue (can go up to (1,1) or right to (2,2))
- It's the most efficient move that doesn't create unnecessary complications

2025-12-10 13:58:49,744 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (2,2) - the bottom-right corner of the 3x3 grid. I have filled 3 out of 9 cells so far, following the path: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). I started at clue 1 at (2,0), visited clue 2 at (2,1), and am now at (2,2) which shows as [3] in my path.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
Looking at the board, I can see there are clues at:
- Clue 1 at (2,0) - already visited
- Clue 2 at (2,1) - already visited
- There's a "4" shown at position (0,0)
- There's a "3" shown at position (0,2)

Wait, I need to clarify: the visual shows "4" at (0,0) and "3" at (0,2). These appear to be clue numbers I need to visit. Since I've visited clues 1 and 2, I should visit clue 3 next, which is at position (0,2).

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
I only have one available move listed: (1,2)

From (2,2), moving to (1,2):
- PROS: This moves me upward toward (0,2) where clue 3 is located. It's the only move available and keeps me on a path toward the next clue.
- CONS: None really, as it's the only option and it progresses toward my goal.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
(1,2) is the only available move and it's strategically sound. It moves me one step closer to clue 3 at (0,2). From (1,2), I'll be able to reach (0,2) on my next move to visit clue 3. This maintains the continuous path requirement and progresses toward visiting all clues in order.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- I am currently at position (1,0)
- I have filled 8 out of 9 cells
- Only 1 cell remains: (0,0)
- I started at clue 1 at (2,0) and visited clue 2 at (2,1)
- My path so far: (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0)

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
- I have already visited all the clues (clue 1 and clue 2)
- Since there are only 2 clues and I've visited both in order (1 -> 2), I just need to complete the path by filling the last remaining cell
- The puzzle requires visiting every cell exactly once, so I must move to (0,0) to complete the puzzle

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Only one move is available: (0,0)
- From (1,0), I can move up to (0,0) or down to (2,0)
- (2,0) has already been visited (it was my starting position with clue 1)
- (0,0) is the only unvisited cell remaining
- Moving to (0,0) will complete the puzzle by filling all 9 cells

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (0,0) is the only valid move
- It's the last empty cell that needs to be filled
- This move completes the puzzle successfully
- All clues have been visited in order (1 -> 2)
- All cells will be visited exactly once

2025-12-10 14:00:20,423 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 14:00:40,076 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells. My path so far is: (0,2) -> (1,2). I started at clue 1 which was at (0,2), and I'm now at (1,2). I need to visit all 9 cells and must visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (1,1).

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (1,1). This is one of my available moves, so I can reach it directly from my current position.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Option A: Move to (2,2)
- CONS: This takes me away from clue 2 at (1,1). I would then need to backtrack or take a longer path to reach clue 2. Given that I have 7 more cells to fill and must visit clue 2 next, moving away from it could create path-blocking issues.
- This would force me into the bottom-right corner, potentially making it harder to create a continuous path through all remaining cells.

Option B: Move to (1,1) - This is where clue 2 is located
- PROS: This directly visits clue 2, which is my required next clue. This follows the rule of visiting clues in ascending order.
- PROS: From (1,1), I'll have good access to multiple areas of the board to continue my path through the remaining 6 cells.
- PROS: Position (1,1) is central, giving me flexibility for future moves.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
Moving to (1,1) is clearly the best choice because:
- It's mandatory to visit clue 2 next (rule 3)
- Clue 2 is at position (1,1)
- This keeps me on track with the puzzle requirements
- The central position will give me good options for completing the remaining path

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (1,1), which is clue 2. I have filled 3 out of 9 cells so far. My path has been: (0,2) [clue 1] -> (1,2) -> (1,1) [clue 2]. I have successfully visited clues 1 and 2 in order. Now I need to visit clue 3, which is located at position (2,1), and then fill the remaining cells to complete the 9-cell path.

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
I need to visit clue 3 next, which is at position (2,1). After that, I need to fill all remaining empty cells to complete the puzzle with a continuous path covering all 9 cells.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

Available moves from (1,1): (0,1), (2,1), (1,0)

- **(2,1)**: This is clue 3! This is exactly where I need to go next. Moving here directly satisfies the requirement to visit clues in ascending order. From (2,1), I would have visited 4/9 cells and would need to fill the remaining 5 cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,2). Let me check if a valid path exists from (2,1) to cover all remaining cells. From (2,1), I could go to (2,0) or (2,2) or (1,1)[already visited]. This seems promising.

- **(0,1)**: This moves away from clue 3. I would need to backtrack later to reach (2,1), which could create path complications and potentially trap myself.

- **(1,0)**: This also moves away from clue 3. Similar to (0,1), this could create unnecessary complications in reaching clue 3.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
The best move is clearly **(2,1)** because:
- It's the location of clue 3, which I must visit next
- It maintains the required ascending order of clue visits
- It doesn't create any unnecessary detours
- From (2,1), I can continue to fill the remaining 5 cells in a logical manner

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 14:03:16,938 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,2), which is clue 1 (my starting point). I have filled 1 out of 9 cells. According to the rules, I must visit all clues in ascending order, so my next target is clue 2, which is located at position (2,1).

2. STRATEGY:
My next mandatory destination is clue 2 at position (2,1). Since I need to visit every cell exactly once and create one continuous path through all 9 cells, I need to plan carefully to avoid trapping myself.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (2,2):
- **(1,2)**: This moves up to the right column. If I go here, I would need to eventually come back down to reach clue 2 at (2,1). This could work, but I need to ensure I can visit all cells.
- **(2,1)**: This moves directly left to clue 2. This is the direct path to my next required clue.

Let me think about the path implications:
- If I move to (2,1) immediately, I'll be at clue 2 with only 2 cells filled. I would then need to fill the remaining 7 cells: (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2).
- If I move to (1,2) first, I'm taking a detour before reaching clue 2. This means I'd need to visit more cells before getting to (2,1), which could create path complications.

Since there are no more clues after clue 2, once I reach (2,1), I just need to ensure I can visit all remaining cells. The most efficient approach is to go directly to clue 2 now, then snake through the remaining cells.

4. DECISION:
Moving directly to (2,1) is the best choice because:
- It fulfills the requirement to visit clue 2 next
- It's the most direct path to the required clue
- From (2,1), I'll have good options to continue the path through the remaining cells (can go to (2,0) or (1,1))
- Starting the path from the bottom and working upward gives me flexibility to fill all cells

2025-12-10 14:03:31,543 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,1), which is clue 2. I have filled 2 out of 9 cells so far. My path has been: (2,2) [clue 1] -> (2,1) [clue 2]. Since I've visited both clues (1 and 2), and clue 2 is the highest numbered clue, I have completed visiting all required clues. Now I need to fill the remaining 7 empty cells to complete the puzzle.

2. STRATEGY:
Since I've already visited all clues in order (1 -> 2), my goal now is to create a continuous path that visits all remaining 7 empty cells exactly once. I need to ensure my path doesn't trap itself and can reach all cells.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (2,1):
- (1,1): Moving up to the center cell. This gives me access to multiple directions and keeps options open.
- (2,0): Moving left to the corner. This is a corner cell with limited connectivity (only 2 neighbors). If I go here now, I might trap myself.

Let me think about path completion:
- Total cells: 9
- Filled: 2
- Remaining: 7

If I move to (2,0) (corner), I would be in a position with only one exit back to (2,1), but (2,1) is already visited. This would be a dead end - INVALID.

If I move to (1,1) (center), I have multiple options to continue: up to (0,1), right to (1,2), or left to (1,0). This keeps the path flexible and allows me to systematically cover all remaining cells.

4. DECISION:
Move to (1,1) is the only viable option. Moving to (2,0) would immediately create a dead end since it's a corner with only one unvisited neighbor, and I still have 7 cells to visit.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 14:04:23,632 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
I am currently at position (0,2) - the top-right corner of the 3x3 grid. I have filled 5 out of 9 cells, meaning I have 4 cells remaining to complete the puzzle. My path so far has been: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2).

Looking at the board:
- Row 0: empty, empty, filled (my current position)
- Row 1: empty, filled, filled
- Row 2: empty (clue 4), filled (clue 2), filled (clue 1)

The unfilled cells are: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (2,0).

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
I've already visited clue 1 at (2,2) and clue 2 at (2,1). Looking at the clue list, there are only 2 clues given (clue 1 and clue 2). Since I've visited both clues in order, I now need to fill the remaining empty cells to complete the path, visiting all 9 cells exactly once.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
From (0,2), I can only move to (0,1) since:
- (0,1) is to the left - this is empty and available
- (1,2) is below - already visited (step 4 of my path)
- Moving right or up would go off the board

So (0,1) is my only valid move.

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
(0,1) is the only available move from my current position. After moving to (0,1), I will need to plan how to reach the remaining 3 cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0). From (0,1), I can reach (0,0) and then work my way down the left column to complete the puzzle: (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0), which would fill all 9 cells perfectly.

MOVE: (0,1)

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- I am currently at position (1,0)
- I have filled 8 out of 9 cells
- Only 1 cell remains empty: (2,0)
- I started at clue 1 at (2,2) and visited clue 2 at (2,1) as required
- My path so far: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0)

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?
- I have already visited all clues (clue 1 and clue 2)
- Clue 2 at (2,1) was the highest numbered clue, and I visited it second in my path
- Since there are no more clues to visit, I just need to complete the path by filling the last remaining cell

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Available move: (2,0)
- This is the ONLY remaining empty cell on the board
- Moving to (2,0) will complete the puzzle by visiting all 9 cells
- This move is valid (vertical move from (1,0) to (2,0))
- This completes the requirement of visiting every cell exactly once

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (2,0) is the only available move and it completes the puzzle
- This fills the last empty cell, satisfying the requirement to visit all 9 cells exactly once
- The path remains continuous with no revisits
- This is the winning move

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 14:06:18,914 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells. My path so far is (0,2) -> (1,2). I started at clue 1 which was at (0,2), and now I need to reach clue 2 which is at position (2,2). Since I must visit all clues in ascending order, my next target is clue 2 at (2,2).

2. STRATEGY:
My immediate goal is to reach clue 2 at position (2,2). However, I also need to ensure that my path allows me to visit ALL 9 cells on the board exactly once. This is critical - I can't just rush to clue 2; I need to plan a path that covers every cell.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (1,2):
- **(2,2)**: This is where clue 2 is located. If I move here directly, I will have only visited 3 cells: (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2). But I need to visit all 9 cells! If I go directly to clue 2 now, I'll be stuck at (2,2) with 6 cells still unvisited. From (2,2), I could only move to (2,1) or back to (1,2) (already visited). This would make it impossible to visit all 9 cells.

- **(1,1)**: This is the center cell. Moving here keeps clue 2 accessible while allowing me to explore more of the board. From (1,1), I would have access to (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), and potentially back toward (1,2) (but that's visited). This gives me more flexibility to create a path that covers all 9 cells before ending at clue 2.

4. DECISION:
I must choose (1,1). Going directly to (2,2) now would trap me and make it impossible to visit all 9 cells. By going to (1,1), I maintain the ability to snake through the remaining cells and eventually reach clue 2 at (2,2) as my final destination after visiting all cells.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 14:07:03,107 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: 
I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 4 out of 9 cells. My path so far is: (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). I started at clue 1 at (0,2) and need to visit clue 2 at (2,2) next. I have 5 more cells to fill to complete the puzzle.

2. STRATEGY:
I must visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (2,2). This is my next mandatory destination according to the rules.

3. EVALUATION:
Available moves from (2,1):
- **(2,0)**: This would take me to the bottom-left corner, moving AWAY from clue 2 at (2,2). If I go here, I would need to backtrack somehow to reach (2,2), but since I can't revisit cells, this could create problems. Let me trace: (2,1) -> (2,0) -> ... I'd need to eventually reach (2,2), but from (2,0) I could only go to (1,0), then (0,0), then (0,1), then back down... but wait, I need to end at (2,2) which is clue 2. Going to (2,0) first means I'd have to visit all remaining cells (2,0), (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and then somehow get to (2,2). From (0,1), I could go to (0,0) [already visited] or (1,1) [already visited] or (0,2) [already visited]. This creates a dead-end situation.

- **(2,2)**: This takes me directly to clue 2, which I must visit next. However, I need to check if I can still visit all remaining cells after reaching (2,2). Remaining unvisited cells after this move would be: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,1). That's 4 cells. Since (2,2) is the final clue and I must END there, I cannot move from (2,2) to fill the remaining cells. This would leave 4 cells unvisited, violating the rule that I must visit every cell.

Wait, let me reconsider. I need to visit clue 2, but I don't have to go there immediately if it means I can't complete the puzzle. Let me think about the full path:

If I go (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> ... but from (0,1) I can't reach (2,2) without revisiting cells.

If I go (2,1) -> (2,2), I'm stuck at the end with 4 unvisited cells.

Actually, I need to fill ALL cells before ending at clue 2. So I should visit the remaining empty cells first, then end at (2,2).

4. DECISION:
I should move to (2,0) to continue filling the board, saving (2,2) for last since it's the final clue where I must end.

2025-12-10 14:07:57,743 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 14:10:27,085 - INFO - THINKING:
Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- Current position: (2,2)
- Progress: 7/9 cells filled
- Path taken: (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)
- Remaining empty cells: (1,1) and (2,1)
- I've already visited the only clue (clue 1 at position (2,0)) at the start

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
- There is only one clue in this puzzle: clue 1 at (2,0)
- I started at clue 1 as required
- Since there are no other clues to visit, I just need to complete the path by visiting all remaining cells
- I need to fill the last 2 cells: (1,1) and (2,1)

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Available move: (2,1)
- From (2,2), I can only move to (2,1) (the cell to my left)
- After moving to (2,1), I will be at position (2,1) with 8/9 cells filled
- From (2,1), I can then move to (1,1) to complete the puzzle (9/9 cells)
- This creates a valid path: (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (2,1) is the only available move from my current position
- This move allows me to continue the path and eventually reach (1,1) to complete all 9 cells
- This is a valid move that doesn't revisit any cells and maintains the continuous path

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Let me analyze the current situation carefully.

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?
- Current position: (2,1)
- Progress: 8/9 cells filled
- Only 1 cell remains empty: (1,1)
- Path so far: (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1)
- Clue 1 is at position (2,0), which was my starting point (correctly followed)
- I need to fill the last remaining cell to complete the puzzle

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next?
- There is only one clue given (Clue 1 at position (2,0))
- I started at Clue 1 as required
- Since there are no other numbered clues (no clue 2, 3, etc.), I just need to complete the path by visiting all cells
- The puzzle requires visiting every cell exactly once, and there's only one cell left

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Available moves: (1,1)
- This is the only available move since it's the only unvisited cell
- Moving to (1,1) will complete the puzzle by filling all 9/9 cells
- From (2,1), moving to (1,1) is a valid vertical move (one step up)
- This move doesn't violate any rules and completes the path

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?
- (1,1) is the only option and the correct move
- It completes the puzzle by visiting all cells exactly once
- The path remains continuous and follows all rules

1. ANALYSIS: 
   - Current position: (1,1)
   - Progress: 9/9 cells filled
   - The puzzle indicates "Available Next Moves: None (stuck!)"
   - Looking at the path taken: (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)
   - All 9 cells have been visited exactly once
   - The only clue given is "1" at position (2,0), which was the starting position

2. STRATEGY:
   - Since all 9 cells are filled and I started at clue 1 (position 2,0), the puzzle appears to be complete
   - There is only one clue (clue 1), so the path should start and end with visiting all cells
   - The path has successfully visited every cell exactly once

3. EVALUATION:
   - The status says "stuck" but actually all cells have been filled
   - The path is complete: started at (2,0) where clue 1 is located, and visited all 9 cells in a continuous path
   - No cells remain unvisited
   - The path follows all rules: no diagonal moves, no revisited cells, continuous path

4. DECISION:
   - This puzzle is actually COMPLETE, not stuck
   - There are no more moves to make because all 9 cells have been visited
   - The path successfully covers the entire 3x3 grid starting from clue 1

The puzzle has been solved successfully. The path visits all cells exactly once, starting from the only clue (1 at position 2,0), and forms a valid continuous path using only horizontal and vertical moves.
