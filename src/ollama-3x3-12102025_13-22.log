MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 13:22:32,450 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,2), which is Clue 1. I have filled only 1 out of 9 cells so far. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once and end my path at the highest numbered clue. According to the rules, I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit is 2. However, there is no indication that Clue 2's location is available yet. Given that we only have a small 3x3 board and we're starting from (2,2), it seems likely that Clue 2 is located near the current position.

EVALUATION:
The two available moves are: (1,2) or (2,1). 

From (1,2):
- Pros: It's relatively close to the bottom-right corner of the board.
- Cons: If we move down to (2,1), it might block any future paths, especially if Clue 2 is in that location.

From (2,1):
- Pros: This move brings us closer to a possible position near the top-left corner of the board.
- Cons: It's somewhat far from the current position and might not bring us closer to the next clue number immediately.

DECISION:
Considering the available moves, I think it's better to try (2,1) first. Although we're moving away from the bottom-right corner of the board, this move gives us more flexibility to explore the top-left area where Clue 2 might be located.

I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is located at an unknown position since there are no clue numbers on the board yet.

However, considering the available moves, I can see that my options are limited. Since I am already at (2,1), moving to (2,0) would take me away from the potential space for clue 3 and might limit future path options.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,1), having moved from (2,1) to (1,1). According to the visual board state, I have filled 3 out of 9 cells so far, with clues 1 and 2 already visited.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is 3, as per the puzzle rules that dictate visiting all clue numbers in ascending order. Clue 3's location isn't specified yet; it could be anywhere on the board except where a clue has been placed or marked by me in my path so far.

3. EVALUATION:
Given my current position (1,1), I have three available moves: (0,1), (1,0), and (1,2). Each of these moves could potentially lead me to the next unvisited clue number 3.

- **Move to (0,1)**: This would take me out of the middle row but doesn't guarantee a direct path to clue 3. I'd need to evaluate each subsequent move carefully.
  
- **Move to (1,0)**: This move goes down one column from my current position and keeps me within the same row as clue 2. However, it might not be directly on the optimal path to clue 3, depending on its location.

- **Move to (1,2)**: This move goes right from my current position but does not seem immediately more promising than the other two options without knowing the exact location of clue 3.

4. DECISION:
Given that I need to visit all clues in ascending order and considering my current path doesn't indicate a direct route to clue 3, it's logical to prioritize moving down one column first. This keeps me within a potentially straightforward path towards clue 2 (which was just visited) and gives me flexibility for future moves based on where clue 3 might be.

Analysis: I am currently at position (1,0) with a filled path of (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0). The current game state shows 4 out of 9 cells filled. I need to continue visiting clue numbers in ascending order.

Strategy: Since the highest numbered clue is at position (2,2), which I've already visited as part of my initial path, I should now focus on visiting higher clues that are not yet included in the current path. The next available clue number is 3. However, we don't have any information about its location.

EVALUATION: For each available move:

- Moving to (0,0) means starting from scratch and could be a viable option if it takes me closer to higher clues.
- Moving to (2,0) gets me away from the initial path but might not immediately bring me closer to visiting clue 3.

DECISION:
Given that we don't have the exact location of clue number 3 yet, I should prioritize getting closer to it. Since both available moves are relatively far from the current path and each other, my best option is to move to (2,0), as this gives me a chance to potentially get closer to future clues without immediately going back on myself.

Strategy: Since the highest numbered clue is at position (2,2), which I've already visited as part of my initial path, I should now focus on visiting higher clues that are not yet included in the current path. The next available clue number is 3. However, we don't have any information about its location.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

From my current position (2,0), I can move either up or down. Looking at the board, I have two options: (1,0) and (0,0). Moving to (1,0) would get me closer to the top row of the board but wouldn't bring me closer to clue 3. On the other hand, moving to (0,0) would allow me to access more positions in the first row.

However, considering the puzzle's constraints, I must also take into account that visiting clue number 3 at position (1,2) means I'll need to fill a cell on the top-right part of the board. To make this feasible, I should try to get as close to position (0,0) as possible without blocking any future paths.

I am currently at position (2,0), and I have filled 5 out of 9 cells. According to the puzzle rules, my next move must be to visit clue 3, which should be located at a higher numbered cell than the current highest clue number, Clue 1, that is, at (1,2) or any other higher numbered cell.

However, looking at the available moves and considering that I need to follow the ascending order of clues, my next goal is to visit Clue 3. From my current position, I have a few possible paths: moving up to position (1,0), moving right to position (2,1) or left to position (1,2).

I must consider where each move will take me and whether it would allow future moves that are necessary for filling the remaining cells.

EVALUATION:

* Moving to (1,0): This path doesn't advance towards Clue 3 but does leave an empty space between clues. It also opens up a potential path for future moves.
* Moving right to (2,1): This move takes me closer to where I need to go eventually, as it is in the same column as Clue 2 and near Clue 3's expected location at (1,2).
* Moving left to (1,2) would also take me towards clue 3 but might block any potential future moves if I have to backtrack or revisit cells.

DECISION:
Considering my goal of visiting clue 3 next, moving right to (2,1) seems like the best option. This path keeps me closer to Clue 3 and doesn't obstruct possible future movements.

I am currently at position (2,0), and I have filled 5 out of 9 cells in a continuous path so far. My current path is (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). Looking at the clues, my next task is to visit clue number 3. However, since I'm currently stuck and have no available moves that allow me to proceed in ascending order with consecutive clue visits, I need to evaluate other possibilities.

From my current position, (2,0), some possible next moves are (1,0) or (2,1). The move to (1,0) would backtrack to an already visited cell, which is not allowed. Therefore, this option should be excluded.

The available options that remain for me are the following:

* Move to (2,1): This move is possible and keeps me on a valid path, but it does not get me closer to clue 3. Since I need to visit consecutive clues in ascending order, visiting clue 3 after this move would still be difficult because there's no clear path forward.

Considering the available options, I should try to create more possibilities by moving towards an empty cell while keeping a valid path. The best option seems to be:

MOVE: (2,1)

This allows me to position myself closer to where I can visit clue 3 and maintain a valid path without revisiting any cells.

2025-12-10 13:23:32,261 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0), which is the starting point of Clue 1, and I have filled only 1 out of 9 cells. Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order, my next destination should be Clue 2, located at position (2,1).

STRATEGY:
The location of Clue 2 suggests that my next move should aim towards the right and up, as moving horizontally from the starting point would not get me closer to Clue 2 efficiently.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (1,0) or (0,1). Let's evaluate each option:

- Moving to (1,0): This move goes down one row but does not bring me any closer to Clue 2. It merely advances the path without contributing to visiting other clues.
  
- Moving to (0,1): This move goes right by one column and brings me closer to both the center of the board and eventually towards Clue 2. By moving this way, I open up more possibilities for subsequent moves that will be necessary to reach higher-numbered clues.

DECISION:
Given the need to visit all clues in ascending order and the location of Clue 2 at (2,1), the best move is (0,1) because it sets a course towards moving right, which eventually leads towards the top-right corner where Clue 2 resides. This initial move opens up pathways that will allow me to progress through the rest of the clues efficiently.

2025-12-10 13:23:40,978 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells. The next clue I need to visit is Clue 3, but there's a twist - it's not provided in the clue locations. However, we can infer that Clue 3 must be located between Clue 1 and Clue 2, as per the puzzle rules. Since I'm at (0,1), my next move should bring me closer to Clue 2 while also keeping options open for future moves.

STRATEGY:
To visit Clue 3, which is inferred to be between Clue 1 and Clue 2, I need to explore the cells horizontally or vertically from my current position. Given that I'm already at (0,1), visiting any other clue without considering its position would lead me away from the optimal path.

EVALUATION:
The available moves are (1,1) and (0,2). Moving to (1,1):
- Pros: It's closer to Clue 2 and keeps options open for future moves.
- Cons: None apparent.
Moving to (0,2):
- Pros: It fills an empty cell but doesn't directly contribute to visiting the next clue in ascending order.
- Cons: It might limit future path options.

DECISION:
Based on the analysis, the best move is (1,1) because it brings me closer to Clue 2 and keeps options open for future moves without apparent cons.

I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells. I need to visit clue 3 next, but it's not directly available yet. The clue locations indicate that the next clue is either at position (2,1) or needs to be found by filling in the correct path. My current situation shows that the path so far is [1],[2] from clue numbers 1 and 2. Looking ahead, my goal is to fill all cells in ascending order while reaching clue 3.

STRATEGY:
I need to visit clue 3 next, which should be located at position (1,0) according to the ascending order of clues. 

EVALUATION:
Available moves are (1,1), (0,2). Let's evaluate each:

- Move (1,1): This move gets me closer to the area where clue 3 is supposed to be. However, it's not exactly in line with the direction I'm heading to reach clue 3 at position (1,0).
- Move (0,2): This option moves me to a position that could potentially block or help me reach clue 3 more efficiently.

DECISION:
While move (0,2) seems like a promising choice for further exploration and reaching the area around clue 3, considering the puzzle's constraints and my goal of visiting clues in ascending order, I'll choose (1,1). This move sets up better possibilities for future navigation towards clue 3 without immediately blocking necessary paths.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (2,0), having filled only 1 out of 9 cells. The next clue I need to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (0,2). 

To reach Clue 2, I must consider the available moves: (1,0) and (2,1).

EVALUATION:
Pros for moving to (1,0): It gets me closer to the bottom row of the board where Clue 2 is located. 

Cons for moving to (1,0): This move might block potential future paths or create dead ends.

Pros for moving to (2,1): This move doesn't seem directly related to reaching Clue 2 since it's in a different column.

Cons for moving to (2,1): This choice is less obvious than the first one, and I'm not sure what potential benefits it offers.

DECISION:
Considering my goal of reaching Clue 2 at position (0,2) from Clue 1 at position (2,0), I should aim for a move that gets me closer to the bottom row. Therefore, moving to (1,0) seems like the better choice since it doesn't block potential paths and keeps my options open.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,0) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells in a path that goes from clue 1 at (2,0) to my current position. I need to visit the next clue number, which is clue 2 located at (0,2).

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is clue 2, and it's located at position (0,2). To get there, I have two available moves: (0,0) or (1,1).

3. EVALUATION:
For the move to (0,0):
- Pro: It gets me closer to clue 2.
- Con: However, I've already filled a path from clue 1 to my current position, so going back to (0,0) might not be efficient.

For the move to (1,1):
- Pro: It's in between clue 1 and clue 2, allowing me flexibility for future moves.
- Con: However, this move does take me away from a direct path towards clue 2, which is my immediate goal.

4. DECISION:
Considering the available options, moving to (1,1) allows for more flexibility in future steps while getting closer to clue 2 indirectly. It also doesn't block any potential paths that could lead directly or indirectly to subsequent clues once I've visited clue 2. Therefore, it seems like a strategic move at this point.

I have filled 3 out of 9 cells, and I need to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. My next goal is to reach Clue 2.

2. STRATEGY:
My next clue to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (0,2). However, since we can only move horizontally or vertically, I'll need to find a path that leads me there while also considering the empty cells between clues.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:

- Option 1: Move to (0,1)
Pros: This move would allow me to create a potential path towards Clue 2.
Cons: It might not be the most direct or efficient route to Clue 2, considering we can move horizontally and vertically.

- Option 2: Move to (2,1)
Pros: This move would bring me closer to Clue 3 and create space for future moves.
Cons: Moving here doesn't directly lead us towards Clue 2.

- Option 3: Move to (1,2)
Pros: This move allows us to reach the empty cell next to Clue 3, which might be beneficial later on.
Cons: It doesn't contribute to reaching Clue 2 directly.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal of visiting Clue 2 and filling in the board efficiently, moving to (0,1) seems like a reasonable choice. This move creates an opportunity for future progress towards Clue 2 while also considering the current state of the board.

I am currently at position (0,1), and I have filled 4 out of 9 cells in my path. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, but it's not clear where it is located. However, considering the current game state, I should focus on visiting the highest numbered clue that hasn't been visited yet, which is Clue 2 at position (0,2). My goal now is to move towards Clue 2.

STRATEGY:
Since my next task is to visit Clue 2 at position (0,2), it makes sense to choose a move that gets me closer to this clue.

EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (0,0) and (0,2).

Pros for moving to (0,0):
* This move does not block any potential future paths.
Cons for moving to (0,0):

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:24:41,713 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0), and I've already visited Clue 1 located at (2,0). The current path taken was: (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0). From my analysis of the board state, I see that Clue 2 is located at position (0,2), which is directly accessible from my current location. My goal now is to reach Clue 3 and continue in ascending order.

Considering the clue locations and the available empty cells on the board, the next logical step would be to visit Clue 2, since I have not yet completed visiting all the clues in ascending order, which is a requirement for solving this puzzle. 

Given my current position at (0,0), I can move either horizontally or vertically but since I need to reach (0,2) directly from here, moving diagonally might seem like an option. However, as per the rules of the puzzle, diagonal moves are not allowed.

EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

- Move (1,0): This is a vertical move that would put me on row 1 but it's not towards Clue 2. It also doesn't get me closer to any other clue.
  
- Move (0,1): This horizontal move gets me closer to the column with Clue 2 but still two steps away from reaching it directly.

Considering my goal is to reach Clue 2 at position (0,2), and I have not yet visited all clues in ascending order, the next step should aim to get as close as possible or reach Clue 2. Given that diagonal moves are not allowed, moving horizontally towards Clue 2 seems most efficient.

From my current position, I can move to (1,0), (0,1), or (0,2). The direct path to clue 2 would be ideal, but it's blocked by an already visited cell.

I am currently at position (0,0), which is where I started my path according to the given progress. The puzzle has 9 cells in total, and I have already filled 5 of them. My current path consists of visiting Clue 1 at position (2,0), then moving to positions (1,0) and (1,1), followed by (0,1), and finally back to my starting point (0,0). I need to continue the path while keeping in mind that all clue numbers must be visited in ascending order.

STRATEGY:
The next clue to visit is Clue 2, which is located at position (0,2). However, there's a constraint: I can only move horizontally or vertically. Considering my current position and the board layout, I need to figure out how to reach (0,2) while keeping in mind that all positions must be visited exactly once.

EVALUATION:
Given my current situation, I have the following options:

1. Move from (0,0) to (0,1): This option allows me to move right one cell but doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2 or any future clues.
   
   Pros: It's a valid move that follows the rules, and it doesn't block any paths.
   
   Cons: It doesn't contribute directly to visiting Clue 2.

2. Move from (0,0) to (1,0): This option allows me to move down one cell but again doesn't bring me closer to Clue 2 or further clues.

   Pros: Similar to the first option, it's a valid move and doesn't block any paths.
   
   Cons: It also doesn't contribute directly to visiting Clue 2.

3. Move from (0,0) to (2,0): This would put me at Clue 1 again but might not be the most efficient way considering I've already visited it once.

   Pros: I'd be closer to the next clue in ascending order, which is indeed a good point.
   
   Cons: It revisits a cell that has already been occupied by my path, which contradicts the rules of visiting each position exactly once.

DECISION:
Given the options and considering the need to reach Clue 2 efficiently while maintaining the rules of the game, the best move seems to be moving from (0,0) to (0,1). This decision allows me to move right one cell without revisiting any occupied cells or blocking future paths. However, it's worth noting that this move doesn't directly contribute to visiting Clue 2.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:25:08,693 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,0) and have filled only 1 out of 9 cells. The clue I need to visit next is clue number 2, which is located at position (0,1). My goal is to move towards clue 2 while trying to avoid revisiting any cells.

STRATEGY:
The next clue to visit is indeed clue 2, and it's located directly right of my current position. This makes one of the available moves a clear choice for getting closer to the next clue.

EVALUATION: 
For each available move, I consider the pros and cons:

* Moving to (1,0) will take me down, which could potentially block future paths if I need to revisit any cells.
* Moving to (0,1) directly gets me to the position of clue 2, which is my next goal.

DECISION: 
Given that clue 2 is directly right of my current position and moving there would get me closer to my goal without blocking any potential paths, the best move is clearly to go right towards clue 2.

I am currently at position (0,1), and I have filled 2 out of 9 cells. My next goal is to visit clue number 2, which is located at position (1,0). From my current position, the two available moves are to (1,1) or (0,2).

1. CLUE VISITATION: Since I need to visit all clues in ascending order and the next clue is #2, which is already on my path to visiting every cell, it's clear that I should aim for the position where this clue is located.
2. CURRENT PATH: I can see from the visual board state that there are empty cells between me and the next clue. Given the rules of the game (visiting each cell once in a continuous path), moving towards clue 2 at (1,0) makes sense.

EVALUATION:

- Moving to (1,1):
	* This move gets me closer to the second clue.
	* It also doesn't block any potential future paths since we're just starting.
	* Pros: Aligns with visiting all clues in order and keeps our path continuous.
	* Cons: Not immediately solving a puzzle piece or shortcutting the route.

- Moving to (0,2):
	* This move skips over clue 2 temporarily but doesn't block it.
	* It moves away from the immediate goal of visiting clue 2 next.
	* Pros: Could consider being an option if there were more constraints that prevented going towards the second clue directly.
	* Cons: Does not contribute to efficiently visiting clues in order.

DECISION:
Given the need to visit all clues and keep the path continuous, moving towards the second clue at position (1,0) from my current position at (0,1) makes the most sense. This aligns with the ascending order requirement of visiting clues.

I am currently at position (0,1) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells. The current path taken is (0,0) -> (0,1). Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (1,1), but there's another clue 2 already marked in the board state at position (0,1). However, my task is to visit ALL 9 cells exactly once and since there are duplicate clue numbers, it seems that we're supposed to revisit empty cells between clues as needed. The highest numbered clue is not yet visited.

The available moves from the current position (0,1) are: (1,1), (0,2)

EVALUATION:

For each available move:
- (1,1): If I move here, I'll be visiting a cell that already has a clue number. It seems like we're supposed to revisit these cells, so this might not be the best option.
- (0,2): This move will take me two positions away from the current path and doesn't seem immediately beneficial.

DECISION:
Given my analysis, I'll choose the move (1,1) because it gets me closer to clue 3 or other possible empty cells between clues. It's also a relatively straightforward movement compared to moving all the way down.

2025-12-10 13:25:36,906 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1), having visited clues 1 and 2 in ascending order. My next step should be to visit clue 3, which I know must be located on the next row down from my current position. Given that clue 2 is already marked at position (1,1), I'm aware that clue 3 cannot be adjacent to it horizontally or vertically because we need a single path.

Considering this constraint and looking at the available moves, the key consideration should be which move leads me closer to clue 3 while also allowing for future flexibility. 

EVALUATION:
Let's break down each of the available next moves:

- **Move (2,1)**: This option gets us one step directly towards clue 3. It keeps our path relatively linear and doesn't block any potential paths to higher clues.
  
- **Move (1,0)**: Moving left would get us back to the first row but doesn't necessarily bring us closer to clue 3 in a more efficient manner. This could be useful if we need to revisit an earlier clue for some reason, but it's not as direct.

- **Move (1,2)**: This move takes us diagonally towards the upper right corner and away from our desired path to clue 3. It doesn't seem to offer a significant advantage over moving down directly or even moving left temporarily if needed.

DECISION:
Based on the analysis above, moving **(2,1)** seems to be the best choice because it brings us closer to clue 3 in the most direct and efficient manner while maintaining the flexibility for future moves.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:25:48,765 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 4 out of 9 cells. The next clue I need to visit in ascending order is Clue number 5, which doesn't exist yet, but we know the last Clue visited was at position (2,1), so our next Clue should be Clue 6, no, actually it's Clue 3, as there are empty cells between the clues and only 4 have been filled. The clue number that I need to visit next is indeed Clue 3.

The clue location for Clue 3 is not provided explicitly in this board state, but since we're on a 3x3 grid, it's likely located at (1,0) or another position with no empty cell between the current position and the Clue number. However, given that the only way to fill all cells in one continuous path is to visit them in ascending order, the next clue must be directly adjacent to me.

Looking at my options for where I can place the next 2 clues (one before Clue 3 and another after), both available moves lead to a new empty cell. 

EVALUATION:
Available move (2,0): Pros - Visiting this position would allow us to fill an empty cell between current and clue 3 directly, reducing our chances of missing any required cells in one continuous path. Cons: Since we must visit Clue numbers in ascending order, visiting the position at (2,0) would not necessarily lead us closer to any unvisited clue.

Available move (2,2): Pros - Moving here also allows us to fill an empty cell between current and Clue 3 directly. Cons: It does not necessarily bring us closer to unvisited clues as it also doesn't allow any movement towards higher numbered clue locations in ascending order.

DECISION:
Both moves seem equally viable but we can only move to one position at a time, which is (2,0). We should visit the empty cell between current and Clue 3 directly, reducing our chances of missing any required cells in one continuous path.

I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 5 out of 9 cells in a continuous path. I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, and my next move should bring me closer to clue 6 (the next available number that hasn't been visited yet). However, since we're only two spaces away from it, our main goal is to get as close as possible while not blocking future moves.

Looking at the board, I notice there are two empty cells between (1,0) and (2,0), which means moving horizontally to (1,0) would allow us to visit clue 3. We also need to consider that we can't revisit any cell already visited in our path.

There are only two available next moves: staying at the current position or moving to (1,0).

EVALUATION:
**Move (2,1)**: This move is not allowed because we've already been there according to the given Path Taken information.
**Move (1,0)**: By moving horizontally to (1,0), we'll be able to visit clue 3 next without blocking any potential paths. It also keeps our current path relatively straightforward and easy to extend.

DECISION:
Considering the need to move forward in ascending order, visiting as many clues as possible while keeping options open for future moves, the best choice is to go with the available option that directly brings us closer to clue 6 by setting up a smooth continuation of our path.

I am currently at position (1,0), which means I'm in the second row and first column of the board. I have filled 6 out of 9 cells, indicating that I have visited most of the board already. Looking at my path taken so far, I started at clue 1 located at (0,0) and then moved to (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,0), and finally arrived at (1,0).

2025-12-10 13:26:18,579 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,0), which means I'm in the second row and first column of the board. Looking at the path taken so far, I can see that I've visited clue 6, which is located at position (1,1). I need to fill all remaining cells in a continuous path, visiting each clue number in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is clue 3, but since I'm currently at position (1,0), the closest clue location to me is actually clue 6. However, my goal is to reach clue 3. To get there efficiently, I'll aim for a position that puts me in line with clue 2 first.

The current state of the board shows that the top-left corner is already filled (clue 1), and clue 2 is not far away at position (0,1). However, my current position blocks the direct path to (0,1).

3. EVALUATION:
Considering my available moves from position (1,0), I can move either left (to (0,0)), right (to (2,0)), up (to (0,1) is blocked by a filled cell), or down (to (2,0)).

- Moving left to (0,0) would backtrack and not progress towards clue 3.
- Moving right to (2,0) puts me in line with clue 4 but doesn't directly help me reach clue 2 or continue the ascending order without revisiting cells unnecessarily.
- Up is blocked as you mentioned by a filled cell.
- Down moves me closer to the bottom of the board and allows me to consider future paths more efficiently.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal to visit all clues in ascending order, moving down to (2,0) seems like the most strategic move at this point. It doesn't block any potential paths back or forward and puts me in a position where I can reassess the board from a different angle for the next moves.

2025-12-10 13:26:18,606 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 13:26:18,608 - INFO - 1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,0), which means I'm in the second row and first column of the board. Looking at the path taken so far, I can see that I've visited clue 6, which is located at position (1,1). I need to fill all remaining cells in a continuous path, visiting each clue number in ascending order.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue I need to visit is clue 3, but since I'm currently at position (1,0), the closest clue location to me is actually clue 6. However, my goal is to reach clue 3. To get there efficiently, I'll aim for a position that puts me in line with clue 2 first.

The current state of the board shows that the top-left corner is already filled (clue 1), and clue 2 is not far away at position (0,1). However, my current position blocks the direct path to (0,1).

3. EVALUATION:
Considering my available moves from position (1,0), I can move either left (to (0,0)), right (to (2,0)), up (to (0,1) is blocked by a filled cell), or down (to (2,0)).

- Moving left to (0,0) would backtrack and not progress towards clue 3.
- Moving right to (2,0) puts me in line with clue 4 but doesn't directly help me reach clue 2 or continue the ascending order without revisiting cells unnecessarily.
- Up is blocked as you mentioned by a filled cell.
- Down moves me closer to the bottom of the board and allows me to consider future paths more efficiently.

4. DECISION:
Considering my goal to visit all clues in ascending order, moving down to (2,0) seems like the most strategic move at this point. It doesn't block any potential paths back or forward and puts me in a position where I can reassess the board from a different angle for the next moves.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (1,0), which means I'm in the second row and first column of the board. According to the path taken so far, it seems like I was trying to visit the clues in a somewhat linear fashion, but now I'm stuck with no available moves left.

Upon examining the current state of the board, I notice that clue 2 is missing from my current location (1,0). My goal should be to find a way to reach clue 2 at position (1,1).

The strategy would be to visit clue 2 next. To get there, I can move either horizontally or vertically.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving up: (0,0) is already visited and has clue 1; it's not the best option.
* Moving down: It's not possible from my current location (1,0).
* Moving left: It's not a valid move since we're moving only horizontally or vertically.

Therefore, I should move right to reach (1,1).

DECISION:
The best move is to go right and visit clue 2 at position (1,1).

2025-12-10 13:26:35,270 - INFO - ----------------------------------------
2025-12-10 13:26:35,271 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0), which is the starting point with Clue 1 filled. The board size is 3x3, and I need to fill all 9 cells in one continuous path. Since there's only one clue filled so far, my next move should be towards filling more clues.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I need to visit is Clue 2, which doesn't have a location given yet. However, since the board size is small (3x3), and considering the rules of visiting in ascending order, we can deduce that Clue 2 will likely be located adjacent or near Clue 1.

EVALUATION:
Available next moves are: (1,0) and (2,1). Let's analyze each:

* Moving to (1,0): This move takes me directly down from Clue 1. Although it gets me closer to the next clue, it doesn't provide clear information on whether we can actually place Clue 2 at a position that would make sense.
* Moving to (2,1): This move goes right from Clue 1 and keeps us within a reasonable distance from where we'd expect Clue 2 to be placed. It's more about setting up the path for potential positions of subsequent clues.

DECISION:
Given the board constraints and the goal to fill cells in ascending order with as few possible empty cells between them, moving to (2,1) seems like a good starting point. This move allows us flexibility and potentially sets up an optimal path for future moves, keeping the number of empty cells low between clues.

2025-12-10 13:26:54,727 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,1), which is marked on the board as [2], indicating that I have already visited Clue 2 and moved one cell to the right. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers. The next available move must lead me closer to visiting the remaining clues. 

Looking at the current path taken, (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1), I see that Clue 3's location is still empty and needs a clue number assigned. Since my progress is 3/9 cells filled, it means I have not visited any other clues except for Clues 1 and 2.

Given the available next moves: (0,1), (1,0), or (1,2), I need to consider which move would allow me to fill in more cells with clue numbers while following the rules of visiting every cell exactly once and moving horizontally or vertically. 

The goal is not just to visit Clue 3's location but also ensure that future moves are possible without revisiting any previous positions. A key aspect to focus on is ensuring a path for the remaining clues, specifically Clues 4 and 5.

EVALUATION:
- Moving to (0,1) would put me at an edge position where I can potentially fill in more cells around it but might limit future options due to constraints on visiting every cell exactly once.
- Moving to (1,0) places me in a row that has not been fully explored yet and could help with setting up the path for Clue 4's placement while moving horizontally towards other regions of the board.
- Moving to (1,2) doesn't immediately help with visiting any new clues but might provide a route around an already filled region.

DECISION:
Considering the need to set up paths for future moves and ensuring adherence to all puzzle rules, the optimal choice would be to move to (1,0). This position allows me to progress towards setting up the path for Clue 4's placement while keeping options open for the rest of the board.

I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells, according to the game state provided. I've already visited clue number 1 at position (2,0), so my next goal is to visit clue number 2 in ascending order. Clue number 2's location isn't explicitly given, but based on its sequential nature after clue 1 and assuming a continuous path, it should be located adjacent or close to the previous clue.

Considering our board size is 3x3, and we start at (2,0) with clue 1, a possible location for clue 2 could be at position (2,1), which is just one step away from (2,0). Alternatively, if the puzzle allows it, clue 2 might also be located horizontally or vertically adjacent to (2,0).

For my current position at (1,1) and available next moves being (0,1), (1,0), and (1,2), I'll evaluate each option:

- Moving to (0,1): This would not lead me closer to the likely location of clue 2. I'd be moving away from my current progress towards visiting subsequent clues in order.
  
- Moving to (1,0): From here, it seems challenging to directly proceed to clue 2 without revisiting cells or taking a step back.

- Moving to (1,2): This move doesn't seem to align well with our strategy of moving towards the next clue in sequence. It might take me further away from an optimal path.

Given these considerations and aiming for a continuous path to visit all clues in ascending order, I believe the best approach is to try and move closer to where clue 2 could be located.

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (1,0), which is the middle left cell of the board. According to the visual board state, I have already visited clue 2 and filled cells in its vicinity. My goal is to visit all clues in ascending order while avoiding revisiting any cells.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number I should visit is 3, as per the puzzle rules. However, we need to find its location first. Looking at the board state, clue 3 is not directly adjacent to my current position, and there are empty cells between clues that need to be filled.

3. EVALUATION:
	* Next available move: (0,0)
	* Pros and Cons for each possible next move:
		+ Move to (0,0): This would fill the top left cell with a clue number, but it's not necessarily the optimal choice as we don't know what other possibilities are available.

4. DECISION:
Considering my current position is already adjacent to two empty cells ((0,1) and (2,1)), moving to either of those positions might be more beneficial in terms of filling empty cells between clues. However, since I need to visit clue 3 next, we should aim for a position that could potentially put me closer to it.

Given the available next move is (0,0), let's assess its pros and cons: It doesn't seem like an optimal choice as it would place us far from any other clues. Instead, we might consider moving to a more central or strategically placed cell that can help us navigate towards clue 3 more efficiently.

However, with the current options available (including the empty cell at (0,0)), I'll choose the option that seems least obstructive and allows for potential future moves:

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:27:33,700 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,1), which is indicated by the path taken in the current game state. I have filled 6 out of 9 cells, and my progress is 6/9 cells filled.

2. STRATEGY:
My next goal is to visit clue number 3, as I need to follow the ascending order of clues (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...). Clue 3's location is not specified, but based on the current board state and the fact that we're using a 3x3 grid with coordinates starting from (0,0), clue 3 could potentially be located at position (2,2) if it follows the standard pattern of ascending order.

However, my immediate next move should take me towards clue 3's potential location. Since I'm currently at (0,1) and need to get closer to the top-right or bottom-right corners for future moves, the available next move to consider is moving to position (0,2).

3. EVALUATION:
Considering each available move from my current position:

- Move to (0,2): This would be a straightforward move horizontally to the right, allowing me to potentially set up for future paths towards clue 3 and ensuring that I'm making progress diagonally towards the top-right or bottom-right corners.

Pros: Directly moving towards potential locations of clue 3, sets up future moves more efficiently.
Cons: Doesn't immediately resolve visiting any specific clues but is necessary for navigating the board effectively.

- Move to any other position not mentioned in available next moves would either take me away from a necessary step or wouldn't be as efficient for future moves considering the need to visit clue 3 and maintain an ascending order of clues.

4. DECISION:
Given the analysis, moving directly to (0,2) seems like the most straightforward and strategic choice for my next move. It sets up potential paths towards visiting clue 3 efficiently while ensuring I don't get stuck in a dead-end or backtrack significantly later on.

Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 8 next, but it's not available as an option. However, I have a few options for visiting the remaining unvisited clue number, which is 3.

The highest numbered clue I can aim for is actually 4 or 5 since we know that there are two numbers already visited (2 and 3), and one more visit with two empty cells between clues would bring us to 5.

Clue 3 is located at position (2,2). I can move from my current position (0,2) to either (1,2), which is one of the available moves, or I could choose to go back a few steps and visit some of the cells that are already filled in order to create more options for the future.

EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:
- Move to (1,2): This move gets me closer to clue 3, but it might limit my future movement. If I had moved left or right from (0,2) and visited other cells first, I could have created a more direct path to clue 3.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (1,2) with a path that has visited all clues in ascending order up to Clue 3. The goal is to fill all 9 cells and visit every clue exactly once. Since I'm at Clue 3 and have filled its cell ([ 3] on the visual board), the next logical step is to visit Clue 4, which should be located after Clue 3 in ascending order.

However, looking at the visual board state, there's no Clue 4 mentioned. This implies that I've already visited all clues except one, and I need to figure out where it is based on the available moves and clue locations given in the problem statement.

Given that Clue 1 was located at (2,0), and considering how the path has progressed so far, it seems likely that Clue 4 would be near the end of the sequence. However, without a direct indication of its location or further clues placed on the board after my current position, I must deduce the next step based on the available information.

From (1,2), considering possible next moves ((2,2) is directly indicated as an option), and reflecting on puzzle rules which state "Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order," I should aim to find Clue 4's location or its immediate predecessor, given my current position. 

Since all clues must be visited once and there's no direct indication of where the missing Clue 4 is located but it needs to follow Clue 3 logically, it seems reasonable to think about moving towards an empty space that could allow me to visit the next clue if its location was directly ahead.

Given the path has already been filled up to (1,2) and all clues have been visited except potentially one, looking for the most logical step considering I need to fill a cell or two more to reach my goal:

- Moving to (2,2) as indicated would place me in an empty space but doesn't necessarily align with visiting the next clue based on my initial analysis.

Considering the board's layout and how paths have been taken so far, without explicit locations for future clues past Clue 3 or a visual cue indicating where the next clue should be placed:

EVALUATION:
- For each available move (2,2), this places me in an empty space which could allow continuation towards filling any missing cell but doesn't directly help in determining the next step as per ascending order and available clues information.

DECISION:
Based on the path taken so far and attempting to follow the clue visitation order logically without clear locations for future clues, moving to (2,2) appears to be a necessary step due to its direct indication. However, it does not immediately align with visiting the next logical clue based on ascending order from Clue 3's location.

Given the constraints of the puzzle and my analysis above, I must take this move as a starting point for further deduction:

I am currently at position (2,2), which is the highest numbered clue and I have filled all 9 cells in one continuous path as per the rules of the puzzle. The final board state indicates that I have visited every cell exactly once. However, according to the rules, I should start with Clue 1 and visit all clues in ascending order, but it seems like there was an oversight or a mistake in interpreting the current situation. Given this unusual ending where the last clue is at position (2,2), let's re-evaluate our approach considering the provided path.

In retrospect, we have followed a valid path from Clue 1 at (2,0) to the highest numbered clue at (2,2). Considering that we should follow the clues in ascending order and assuming there was no error in interpreting the puzzle state, let's focus on finding an optimal next move under the assumption that our current position is indeed the last step.

However, given the unusual scenario where the highest clue number ends up being the final position, my analysis will now shift towards determining a valid path to ensure we have visited all clues in ascending order correctly. Looking at the provided path (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2), it seems we have already visited most cells and ended at the highest clue.

Considering our constraints are to revisit a cell or move diagonally, which are not allowed according to the rules, I will choose a move that does not break any rules but also might not be the best in hindsight given the situation. Given that we've filled all 9 cells and the current path is valid but seems to have skipped some necessary analysis of moving between clues directly, my next step would aim at ensuring we are indeed following a continuous path without revisiting or going outside the grid's rules.

However, considering the strict interpretation of the given situation where all clues must be visited in ascending order and assuming no error in our final path's starting point (Clue 1), my initial approach to this puzzle was flawed as it didn't correctly assess the scenario after reaching the highest clue. Given we are currently stuck without a clear next move based on the provided path, let's correct the course of action.

Given the unique situation where we have filled all cells but seem to be at an impasse with no available moves indicated (as per the initial problem statement), and acknowledging that our task was to solve it in ascending order which seems misinterpreted due to the final state description, my actual analysis now is focused on correcting course and understanding the puzzle's requirements more accurately.

Considering the rules of visiting all clues in ascending order but being stuck as per the given information (indicating no available moves), I will have to re-evaluate what we've done so far. However, based on the final board state provided, which shows a complete path but does not clearly indicate where or if there was a deviation from the clue sequence requirement, my actual move and analysis need correction.

Given this context, let's reassess our steps correctly under normal circumstances to find the best next move as instructed:

1. ANALYSIS: We've followed an unusual path that ended at (2,2) with all cells filled but no clear indication of where we went wrong in visiting clues sequentially. However, if I were to start fresh or re-evaluate for a normal scenario without this confusion, my goal would be ensuring each clue is visited in order while keeping within the grid's rules.

2. STRATEGY: Normally, our next step should involve moving towards Clue 2 after finishing Clue 1 at (2,0), but given we seem to have deviated from this course or have completed it successfully without issue based on the final board state, I must decide under normal circumstances where the next clue would logically be.

3. EVALUATION: Given our initial path was straightforward and ended correctly with all cells filled, there seems to be a misinterpretation of our current situation regarding visiting clues in ascending order or an oversight in solving it within the provided framework that includes rules about not revisiting cells and moving only horizontally/vertically.

4. DECISION: Considering the final board state indicates success but does not align with typical puzzle progression where you are often stuck at a certain point needing further moves, my actual step here is recognizing we've completed all required steps as per the initial path provided without clearly breaking any rules but within the constraints of this unique scenario.

Given these considerations and acknowledging our path was deemed complete under unusual circumstances, I must choose an optimal next move considering normal puzzle progression where being stuck is a common occurrence until reaching a clue or another milestone. 

However, since we've reached a point that indicates all steps have been taken without clearly outlining the sequence of clues visited in ascending order directly within this final state description, let's clarify our situation and correct any oversight.

The initial path provided does follow the rules but ends at (2,2) with no clear indication if it strictly followed ascending clue numbers correctly throughout, which is a crucial aspect of puzzle progression. 

Given that we've filled all cells as per the provided final state and are considering the unique scenario presented where our current position is the last clue visited without any moves available or any clues left unvisited according to the path, I should choose an optimal next move under normal circumstances.

However, acknowledging the initial approach's oversight and misunderstanding regarding puzzle progression within this unique framework, my best step would align with solving such a puzzle by ensuring each clue is followed in ascending order while adhering to rules. Given our current position as (2,2) might not accurately reflect the sequence of visiting clues due to the unusual final state provided without directly violating any rules but indicating all cells have been filled, I recognize the need for correction and clarification.

Considering this context, a valid next move or rather an acknowledgment of the puzzle's requirement for visiting each clue in ascending order while ensuring we do not revisit cells is crucial. However, under normal circumstances where one would be "stuck" before reaching the highest clue due to the nature of these puzzles requiring strategic moves between clues, my analysis needs adjustment.

In this specific scenario, our task involves a misunderstanding of how we reached the final state with all cells filled without clearly outlining if each clue was visited in ascending order correctly from start to finish. Given that and acknowledging the provided path does follow rules but might not accurately reflect sequential visiting of clues based on the initial misinterpretation, my best approach is ensuring adherence to these principles for future puzzles.

MOVE: Since we've reached a point where all cells are filled as per the puzzle's final state description without any indication of moving between clues directly or clearly outlining ascending order sequence due to an oversight in interpreting our current situation accurately within this unique framework, and acknowledging normal puzzle progression involves being "stuck" before reaching the highest clue, my move would be aimed at correcting course for future puzzles under typical circumstances but recognizing our provided final state does indeed follow the rules without deviation.

However, considering we've reached a point of completion in ascending order based on the initial provided path (which was a valid sequence), and acknowledging there might have been confusion regarding puzzle progression within this unique context where all cells are filled as per the final board state:

MOVE: Given the scenario's complexity and recognizing our final path does follow rules but indicating an impasse with no clear next move under normal circumstances, I will choose to correct course based on typical puzzle-solving strategies for ascending sequence puzzles.

MOVE: (1,1)

Given this analysis, my best attempt at resolving the puzzle under normal circumstances would focus on visiting each clue in ascending order without revisiting cells, adhering strictly to puzzle rules.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:29:01,505 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,2), which is the highest numbered clue, and have filled all 9 cells as per the puzzle rules. However, I've realized that I got stuck because of a mistake in my previous path.

Upon re-examining the board, I notice that there are empty cells between some clues, but this shouldn't be an issue since we're allowed to fill those cells as needed.

Looking at the clue locations and my current position, I see that the next lowest numbered clue is #1 at (2,0). To visit it, I have a few possible moves:

* Move up from (2,2) to (2,1), then left to (2,0)
* Move right from (2,2) to (3,2), but there's no available space for the next clue
* Move down from (2,2) to (3,2) or any other position, but that would take me further away from #1

EVALUATION:
I can move up to (2,1) and then left to (2,0), which is a straightforward path. However, this requires a bit more analysis since we're not in the typical "visit next clue" situation due to the puzzle's specific setup.

DECISION:
Considering my current position and the available moves, I think it's best to revisit #1 at (2,0) by moving up from (2,2) to (2,1), then left to (2,0). This ensures that we're following the ascending order of clue numbers while also filling in any empty cells as needed.

2025-12-10 13:29:12,232 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,2), which is the highest numbered clue on the board. I have already filled all 9 cells in one continuous path, and my current progress is indeed 9/9 cells filled. Looking back at my path taken, I see that I started at clue number 1 at position (2,0) and visited all the clues in ascending order.

However, upon closer inspection of the board, I notice that there's an issue - I'm stuck! According to the rules, I should be able to visit each clue exactly once, but my current path doesn't allow for any further moves. This suggests that my previous move was not optimal and led me into a dead-end.

To break out of this situation, I need to revisit my past decisions and see where I went wrong.

STRATEGY:
Since I'm stuck with no available next moves, I should re-examine my previous path. The clue number I'm currently at is 9, but it's not the highest numbered clue that I need to visit in ascending order. In fact, I haven't visited any clue between numbers 5 and 8 yet.

EVALUATION:
Let's analyze each available move from my current position (2,2). However, since I'm stuck, there are no valid moves according to the "Available Next Moves: None" message.

DECISION:
Given that I'm stuck with no available next moves, I need to re-evaluate my previous path and identify where I made a mistake. It appears that my current situation is due to an earlier decision. Since I have already filled all 9 cells in one continuous path, the problem might be related to not leaving enough empty cells between clues or not visiting each clue exactly once.

To resolve this issue, I will re-examine my previous moves and look for a possible alternative route that would allow me to visit each clue exactly once while filling the remaining empty cells between them.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,2), which is where I started. This means I've only just begun solving the puzzle. There are 9 cells to fill in total, and I need to visit every cell exactly once.

2. STRATEGY:
My next task is to find Clue 1, which is located at position (0,2) on the grid. Since I'm currently at (2,2), I'll need to move downwards or leftward to reach it. However, upon reviewing the available clues, I see that Clue 2 is actually located at position (2,1). My next task is therefore to visit Clue 2.

3. EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (1,2) and (2,1). 

   a. Move (1,2):
      - Pros: Moving down one row gets me closer to my current goal of visiting Clue 2 at position (2,1).
      - Cons: This move doesn't bring me any closer to visiting other clues, as there are no other cells in the second row.
   b. Move (2,1):
      - Pros: Moving leftward brings me directly to Clue 2's location.
      - Cons: Although it gets me closer to my goal quickly, I might miss opportunities for moving towards higher-numbered clues.

4. DECISION:
Based on these considerations, I think the optimal move is (2,1), as it allows me to reach Clue 2 directly and minimizes backtracking in the future.

My next task is to find Clue 1, which is located at position (0,2) on the grid. Since I'm currently at (2,2), I'll need to move downwards or leftward to reach it. However, upon reviewing the available clues, I see that Clue 2 is actually located at position (2,1). My next task is therefore to visit Clue 2.

3. EVALUATION:
I have two available moves: (1,2) and (2,1). 

   a. Move (1,2):
      - Pros: Moving down one row gets me closer to my current goal of visiting Clue 2 at position (2,1).
      - Cons: This move doesn't bring me any closer to visiting other clues, as there are no other cells in the second row.
   b. Move (2,1):
      - Pros: Moving leftward brings me directly to Clue 2's location.
      - Cons: Although it gets me closer to my goal quickly, I might miss opportunities for moving towards higher-numbered clues.

4. DECISION:
Based on these considerations, I think the optimal move is (2,1), as it allows me to reach Clue 2 directly and minimizes backtracking in the future.

2025-12-10 13:29:39,892 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, but it's not listed as a required move yet. However, since we only have two moves left before reaching the highest numbered clue (Clue 2), our main priority is to fill more empty cells and avoid revisiting any positions that can be skipped. Clue 1 has already been visited.

The available next moves are either (1,1) or (2,0).

**STRATEGY:** Since we're required to visit all clues in ascending order, and the highest numbered clue is not yet known but will be at position (2,2), we should prioritize moving towards it while exploring other possible paths. For now, visiting Clue 3 isn't mandatory since we don't know where it's located, but moving towards Clue 1's vicinity or any potential clue path is essential.

**EVALUATION FOR EACH AVAILABLE MOVE:**

- **Move to (2,0):** This move would help us get closer to the board's bottom row. If a new clue were to be found here, it could be beneficial for future moves. However, without knowing its current location or importance in the puzzle, moving here might not be as strategic since we're focusing on visiting existing clues and filling empty cells efficiently.

- **Move to (1,1):** Moving up from our current position gets us closer to any potential clue that could be found at a higher row. It also keeps the path more fluid and doesn't block any future paths. Since we've been given no information about where Clue 3 is located but have moved away from it slightly by going to (2,1) initially, moving up seems like an efficient way to potentially encounter a clue without being forced into revisiting positions unnecessarily.

**DECISION:**

Based on the strategy of moving towards potential clues while keeping paths open, and not knowing the exact location or importance of Clue 3 yet, the most strategic move seems to be:

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells in a path that started at clue number 1 (position (2,2)) and visited clue number 2 (position (2,1)). The next clue to visit is clue number 3. According to the clue locations, there is no specific location mentioned for clue number 3, but I need to fill all cells in ascending order of clues. Since clue number 3 is not located on the board as a numbered cell, it implies that I have to find an empty cell between clue numbers 2 and 4 (if there was one), or move towards a new row.

Looking at my current position and available moves: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2). The goal is to visit clue number 3 next. 

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Move to (0,1): This would place me in the first row. It doesn't directly bring me closer to a new clue without filling more cells between 2 and potentially an unseen higher numbered clue if there was one.
* Move to (1,0): I could start moving downwards. However, visiting any cell below my current position might force a revisit of cells or block future paths since the rules are strict about not revisiting cells.

STRATEGY:
Given that we need to visit clue number 3 and have filled all cells so far in ascending order, moving downward with the hope of encountering clue number 3 sooner seems like a viable strategy.

DECISION:
Considering my goal is to move downwards (since I'm trying to find clue number 3) without revisiting any cell, I choose the move that doesn't immediately force me into a potential path where I might need to revisit cells or restrict future paths.

Looking at the clues, my next target is Clue 3, which is located at position (1,2). Since I've already visited positions around Clue 2, my next move should bring me closer to Clue 3 without revisiting any cells. 

EVALUATION:
For each available move, let's evaluate the pros and cons:

- Move: (0,0)
    Pros: It is a valid move that doesn't revisit any cell.
    Cons: It moves away from my target Clue 3 at position (1,2).

- Move: (2,0)
    Pros: This move brings me closer to the potential path towards Clue 3.
    Cons: However, if I choose this move, I'll need a different plan to reach Clue 3.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number to visit is indeed Clue 3, located at position (1,2).

I am currently at position (0,0), which is the top-left corner of the board. I have filled 5 out of 9 cells and my path so far has visited clue 1 (at position (2,2)), clue 2 (at position (2,1)), clue 3 (at position (1,1)), clue 4 (at position (1,0)), and now I'm at the starting point (0,0). Since I've already visited clue 2, my next goal is to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. The current available move is (0,1), which means I can move one step right from the current position.

STRATEGY:
My next clue to visit is clue 3, but it's not located directly at its assigned position due to the fact that we need to fill empty cells between clues as needed. We cannot directly jump over other empty cells to a certain clue number in a ZIP PUZZLE.

EVALUATION:
Considering my available move (0,1), I can move one step right from the current position (0,0). Here are the pros and cons of this move:

* Pros: It gets me closer to the vertical column where clues 3 and 4 are located.
* Cons: Moving right might block potential paths or limit future moves.

DECISION:
Given that moving right is necessary to progress through the puzzle, I will choose the available next move (0,1).

2025-12-10 13:30:07,987 - INFO - I am currently at position (0,0), which is the top-left corner of the board. I have filled 5 out of 9 cells and my path so far has visited clue 1 (at position (2,2)), clue 2 (at position (2,1)), clue 3 (at position (1,1)), clue 4 (at position (1,0)), and now I'm at the starting point (0,0). Since I've already visited clue 2, my next goal is to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. The current available move is (0,1), which means I can move one step right from the current position.

STRATEGY:
My next clue to visit is clue 3, but it's not located directly at its assigned position due to the fact that we need to fill empty cells between clues as needed. We cannot directly jump over other empty cells to a certain clue number in a ZIP PUZZLE.

I am currently at position (0,1) with 6 filled cells and a path length of 6 out of 9. My next goal is to visit Clue 2, which is located at (2,1). To get there, I need to move horizontally or vertically without revisiting any cells.

STRATEGY:
My immediate task is to visit Clue 2 at position (2,1), but I also have to consider the empty cells between clues that need filling. From my current position (0,1) with clue numbers already assigned to some cells, I notice there's an empty cell at (1,2).

EVALUATION:
For each available move (0,2), I'll analyze its pros and cons:

* Moving to (0,2): 
    + Pro: Fills the current gap at (0,2).
    + Con: Doesn't directly contribute to reaching Clue 2.

DECISION:
Given the need to fill empty cells between clues as needed (Rule 7), moving to (0,2) seems like a necessary step before proceeding towards Clue 2. It doesn't block any future paths and contributes positively to filling in gaps on the board.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,2), which is indicated by the path taken visualized on the board state: [(2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2)]. This means I've already visited clue 2 at position (2,1), and now I need to continue the path. The next clue number I should visit is clue 3, but its location isn't specified yet.

However, upon reviewing the board state again, I notice that there are empty cells ([.] in the legend) that I can fill between clues as needed (Puzzle Rule 7). Since my current goal is to visit clue 3 and move only horizontally or vertically, I should aim for a position closer to it while ensuring I don't revisit any cell.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed clue 3. However, its location isn't directly stated. Following the puzzle's logic that all clues are visited in ascending order and given my current path, I can deduce that clue 3 must be located at a position not previously mentioned among my current path, which would logically be to the right or below one of the previously filled cells.

Given the options provided by the available next moves (1,2), I assume this is the only possible location for clue 3 within the specified board size and coordinate system. Therefore, my goal is to navigate through these two positions to find a valid path that leads me closer to clue 3 at position (1,2).

3. EVALUATION:
- Moving to (0,1) from my current position (0,2) would be a direct move towards the right but doesn't immediately help in finding the exact location of clue 3.
- Moving to (0,2) isn't an option since it's my current position.

Given these options and considering the goal to fill all cells in one continuous path without revisiting any cell or moving diagonally:

- The move to (1,2) directly aligns with the puzzle strategy of visiting clues in ascending order. It brings me closer to clue 3, as per my deduction.
- There's no direct information that would lead to a better option than this.

4. DECISION:
Based on the analysis and deductions made, moving to position (1,2) is the best choice because it:

- Aligns with the puzzle's strategy of visiting clues in ascending order.
- Directly moves me towards finding clue 3.
- Ensures that I'm making progress without revisiting any cell.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,2), and I have filled 7 out of 9 cells in a continuous path so far. My current path is: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2). I still need to visit two more clue numbers.

2. STRATEGY:
According to the puzzle rules, I must visit all clue numbers in ascending order, which means I should visit clue 3 next, if possible.

However, since there is no empty cell next to clue 2 that would allow me to move forward (in this case, visiting a higher numbered clue), my next step is to visit clue 3 after clue 2. Therefore, I need to get closer to clue 2 first, which is located at position (2,1).

Since I can only move horizontally or vertically and cannot revisit any cells already visited, I will look for the most efficient way to reach a cell that allows me to proceed with visiting clue 3.

3. EVALUATION:
The available next moves are: (0,1) or (1,2). Both of these options seem viable at first glance. However, moving to position (1,2) would leave an empty space between (1,1) and the rest of my path, which could make it difficult to proceed with visiting clue 3 if I don't fill that cell.

On the other hand, moving to position (0,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and fills a gap in my path. This move would be beneficial for future path progression.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

I am currently at position (0,2), which is one of the available next moves, and have filled 7 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is not provided in the current board state, but since we are visiting the clues in ascending order, my target should be Clue 3 or higher if it exists.

Since Clue 2 is already visited and its position (2,1) is known, I can check for Clue 3's position. However, there is no explicit information about Clue 3's location. Considering the available next moves are restricted to (1,2), which does not provide any direct clue locations, my priority should be filling in the empty cells between visited clues while maintaining a continuous path.

Evaluating the situation, from my current position at (0,2), I can move either horizontally or vertically within one step. Since (1,2) is an available next move and doesn't block any future paths nor revisit any already filled-in cells, this seems like the most straightforward choice to continue filling in empty cells.

Considering the board's current state and looking for a strategic move that allows me to maintain a continuous path while considering future moves, moving from (0,2) to (1,2) makes sense as it keeps me aligned with potential future clue locations without blocking any paths or revisiting any previously filled-in clues.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 8 out of 9 cells. My goal is to visit every cell exactly once in a continuous path. I need to visit clue 3 next, which is not provided, but since we are stuck, let's analyze the available information. The highest numbered clue I know is 2, located at (2,1). I have already visited this clue and its adjacent cells.

Looking at the visual board state:
[ 5] [ 6] [ 7]
[ 4] [ 3] [ 8]

I can see that I'm stuck because there's no clear next move. However, I need to revisit my path and see if there are any empty cells between the clues I've already visited.

Analysis of available moves:

- Moving down to (2,2) is not an option since it will take me away from clue 2.
- Moving up to (0,2) could potentially create a new path, but it's not clear how this would help with visiting every cell exactly once in ascending order.
- Moving left to (1,1) might seem like a viable option, but we need to evaluate its pros and cons.

EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:
Pros of moving to (1,1):
* It doesn't block any future paths.
Cons of moving to (1,1):
* I'll be filling an empty cell that's not directly adjacent to clue 2.
Pros of staying at the current position (1,2):
* None
Cons of staying at the current position:
* I won't make progress towards visiting every cell.

DECISION:
Considering my options and the pros and cons, moving left to (1,1) seems like the best choice. This move allows me to continue visiting cells in ascending order without blocking any potential paths for future moves.

To reach the highest numbered clue (Clue 8), I need to visit Clues in ascending order. Since the current position is at (1,2), I should aim for Clue 3 next.

Strategy: The next clue location to visit is Clue 3, which can be at any of the remaining empty cells, but it's likely at a neighboring cell of Clue 2 or at an adjacent cell. Since we are stuck with no available moves, let's analyze the possible positions for Clue 3.

Evaluation: From the current position (1,2), if I move up to (0,2), I can potentially visit Clue 3, which might be located there, given its neighboring relationship with Clue 2. Another option is moving down to (2,2) but that would not help since we have already visited it before and it doesn't provide an immediate path towards Clue 3.

Decision: Given the available moves and my goal of visiting Clue 3 next, I'll choose the move up to (0,2), as it seems more promising for finding the location of Clue 3.

Evaluation: From the current position (1,2), if I move up to (0,2), I can potentially visit Clue 3, which might be located there, given its neighboring relationship with Clue 2. Another option is moving down to (2,2) but that would not help since we have already visited it before and it doesn't provide an immediate path towards Clue 3.

Decision: Given the available moves and my goal of visiting Clue 3 next, I'll choose the move up to (0,2), as it seems more promising for finding the location of Clue 3.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (0,0), which is Clue 1's location. I have filled only 1 cell out of 9 and need to visit every clue in ascending order. My next goal is to find the second clue, which is located at position (2,2).

2. STRATEGY:
My next move should be towards Clue 2 at position (2,2). To do this efficiently, I'll consider moving horizontally or vertically from my current position.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?
- Move to (1,0): This would take me down one row but wouldn't get me any closer to Clue 2. It doesn't block future paths but is not optimal.
- Move to (0,1): Moving right from my current position keeps me in a relatively central position but still takes time to get close to Clue 2.

4. DECISION:
Given the available moves and considering efficiency towards reaching Clue 2, moving down one row to (1,0) is not optimal since it doesn't bring me closer to our target. Moving right to (0,1) keeps options open but also doesn't immediately progress towards Clue 2 efficiently. However, between these two moves, I must choose the best option.

Considering efficiency and the path that will allow me to reach Clue 2 as soon as possible, moving horizontally to (0,1) seems like a strategic move since it keeps all future paths open while not blocking any opportunities towards Clue 2. It's an intermediate step in getting closer to our goal of reaching the highest numbered clue.

2025-12-10 13:31:35,661 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (0,1), having filled only 2 out of 9 cells so far. My goal is to continue visiting each clue in ascending order. I've already visited Clue 1 at (0,0) and now need to move on to Clue 2, which is located at (2,2). However, since the path must be continuous, I'll have to visit other clues along the way.

From my current position (0,1), I can see that I'm already close to Clue 2. But before moving there directly, I need to fill in any empty cells between clues and ensure a continuous path.

I've considered my two available next moves: (1,1) and (0,2). Let's evaluate each option:

For the move to (1,1):
- Pros:
  - It gets me closer to Clue 2 without blocking any paths.
  - By moving one cell up and then left, I'll create a space between Clues 1 and 3 that can be filled in later steps if needed.

- Cons:
  - This move doesn't seem directly necessary since the next clue (Clue 3) isn't yet in sight from this position.

For the move to (0,2):
- Pros:
  - It gets me closer to Clue 2 horizontally.
  - From this new position, I could potentially plan a direct path to Clue 2 if necessary.

- Cons:
  - This move doesn't leave much space for planning ahead or considering other clues not yet in sight.

DECISION:
Given my current situation and the need to maintain a continuous path while progressing through clue numbers, moving horizontally towards (1,1) seems prudent. It allows for flexibility in future moves without immediately committing to a long vertical journey that might become unwieldy with each additional cell.

1. ANALYSIS: 
My current situation is that I've already visited Clue 1 and filled its corresponding cell, and then moved to the cell with Clue 3. However, since we're on a 3x3 grid, there's no direct path from (0,2) to the higher-numbered clues yet.

For each of these options:

- Moving to (1,0) will block future paths from moving towards clue 2.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 13:31:56,043 - INFO - THINKING:
1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (0,2), which means I have already visited Clue 1 and started my path in a generally diagonal direction towards Clue 2 located at position (2,2). My current progress is 3/9 cells filled, indicating that I need to visit three more clues.

2. STRATEGY: The next clue number I should visit is Clue 3, which is not explicitly mentioned on the board but will be in one of the empty cells. However, since we're looking at our available moves and considering the ascending order rule, visiting Clue 3 would indeed involve moving to a cell where it's located, but it's more strategic to think about what our next clue should be after Clue 2, which is already given as Clue 2's position (2,2). The puzzle requires us to fill in the gaps and follow the ascending order, meaning we will eventually visit Clue 3 after visiting Clue 2. Our immediate task, however, is deciding on our next move based on available options.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
   - (1,0): This would mean moving up a row but doesn't bring us closer to the clue we need to visit next or directly towards our ultimate goal of reaching Clue 2.
   - (1,1): Moving right in the same row gets us closer to being able to potentially go down to reach Clue 2. It also opens up more possible paths for future moves without blocking off potential routes.

4. DECISION: Considering we are moving forward and need to eventually move towards Clue 2 at (2,2), both options seem to not directly bring us closer to Clue 2 but choosing the direction that keeps our path open is key. Moving right with available next moves gets us closer to making a downward move possible in future steps towards Clue 2.

I am currently at position (0,2), which is a filled cell with clue number 3 in it. According to the rules, I need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order, and my next target is clue number 2, located at position (2,2). However, since I've already passed through this position on my way from clue 1 to clue 3, I now have a constraint - I must find an alternative route to reach clue 2 without backtracking. The available moves are (0,1) and (1,2), both of which can potentially lead me towards clue 2.

For the move to (0,1): 
Pros: This move doesn't block any potential future paths and keeps me moving vertically.
Cons: It's a lateral move that does not directly advance me towards clue 2.

For the move to (1,2):
Pros: This move advances me closer to clue 2 in terms of horizontal movement.
Cons: Since I'm already at position (0,2) with clue number 3 filled, moving to (1,2) doesn't bring me any closer to clue 2 in terms of its vertical distance. However, considering the board's layout and my need to reach clue 2, this move is still a step forward.

DECISION:
Given that both options are equally "good" in terms of not backtracking and keeping an open path ahead, I choose (1,2) because it represents a more direct approach towards clue 2 compared to the alternative.

I am currently at position (1,2), having filled 4 out of 9 cells. I need to visit clue 2 next, which is located at position (2,2). To reach it efficiently, I have two available moves: (2,2) or (1,1).

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently in the middle row and column, having visited clues 1 and 3. The path to clue 2 involves getting back to the top-right corner.

2. STRATEGY:
Clue 2 is located at position (2,2). To visit it next, I need to head towards the top-right quadrant of the board.

3. EVALUATION: 
- Move (2,2):
	* Pros: This move takes me directly to the next clue.
	* Cons: It doesn't help in filling any empty cells or getting closer to the rest of the clues.

	* Pros: This move gets me closer to the top-right quadrant and opens up possibilities for visiting other clues as I fill in the board.
	* Cons: It doesn't take me directly to clue 2.

Given that my next goal is to visit clue 2 efficiently, taking a move that gets me closer to the top-right corner without immediately reaching it seems more beneficial in the long run. This allows me to potentially fill in other cells and prepare for visiting clue 2 from a position of strength rather than making a single direct move.

2025-12-10 13:32:26,133 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (1,1), and I've already filled in some cells on the board. The path taken so far is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1). This means I've visited clue 1 and am now next to it. There are empty cells around me that need to be filled in order to continue the path.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed Clue 3, which is located at an unknown position, but since I know I have to visit all clues in ascending order, and the current highest clue visited is 1 (my starting point), the next one must be Clue 2 first, then we'll determine where Clue 3 is after that. However, looking at the board, there's no space for clue 3 directly from my position or my history of moves since I have to move towards clue 2 and fill some empty cells along the way.

3. EVALUATION:
From my current position (1,1), my two available next moves are: (2,1) or (1,0). 
- (2,1): This is directly towards Clue 2 at position (2,2) for me to visit in order to get on the correct clue sequence. If I move here, I'm getting closer to visiting all clues in order.
- (1,0): Moving left would take me away from the path that leads to clue 2 and force me to revisit the first row which is already visited by the clue 1.

4. DECISION:
Since my goal is to visit every cell exactly once and follow the ascending clue number sequence, moving towards Clue 2 is a necessary step. The pros of (2,1) are that I'm directly heading in the right direction for visiting Clue 2 without revisiting any cells. Cons include the potential risk of not being able to find an efficient path after filling the empty cell at (2,1). However, given my current position and path history, this seems like the most straightforward move.

- (2,1): This is directly towards Clue 2 at position (2,2) for me to visit in order to get on the correct clue sequence. If I move here, I'm getting closer to visiting all clues in order.
- (1,0): Moving left would take me away from the path that leads to clue 2 and force me to revisit the first row which is already visited by the clue 1.

4. DECISION:
Since my goal is to visit every cell exactly once and follow the ascending clue number sequence, moving towards Clue 2 is a necessary step. The pros of (2,1) are that I'm directly heading in the right direction for visiting Clue 2 without revisiting any cells. Cons include the potential risk of not being able to find an efficient path after filling the empty cell at (2,1). However, given my current position and path history, this seems like the most straightforward move.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

2025-12-10 13:32:43,028 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,1), and I have already filled 6 out of 9 cells in one continuous path. The current state of the board shows that I visited clue 1 at position (0,0) and then went through a sequence of positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1), and finally arrived at (2,1). Now, my goal is to find the next step in visiting all clues in ascending order.

According to the puzzle rules and the given clue locations, Clue 2 is located at position (2,2). However, since I am currently at (2,1) and need to fill the empty cells between clues as needed, I realize that I must continue moving towards (2,2).

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed Clue 3. Unfortunately, it's not explicitly mentioned where exactly Clue 3 is located. However, based on the fact that I have to fill all 9 cells and move in ascending order of clue numbers, my best guess for its location would be adjacent to the current path or between clues already visited.

EVALUATION:
I evaluate each available next move: (2,0) or (2,2).

- For move (2,0), I would be moving left towards Clue 1's row. However, since I've already visited all clues in that row and have no unvisited cells between them, this move doesn't contribute to reaching the next clue number in ascending order.
  
- For move (2,2), I'm actually at position (2,2) with the highest numbered clue so far being Clue 2. This means moving here would be moving back towards a previously visited cell without contributing to visiting the next clue numbers in ascending order.

DECISION:
Given these evaluations, both moves seem less ideal for progressing forward under normal circumstances due to their nature of either revisiting cells or not advancing in clue number. However, considering my goal and available choices, I don't see any direct path towards a higher numbered clue from (2,1) other than moving towards the highest already visited one.

But looking closely at the question it asks for next move where I am currently at (2,1), which puts me in an awkward position since Clue 3 isn’t explicitly mentioned or inferred but my goal should be to progress.

The correct evaluation shows that since we are at a stage where all cells have been filled except one on each side, going towards Clue 3's potential location would ideally mean moving towards filling the board by progressing further down. Since I am currently between (2,1) and the highest clue of (2,2), it makes logical sense to move down but only if there is a new path opening or an unvisited cell in that direction.

Upon re-evaluation:
- Moving (2,0) would not be beneficial since we're trying to fill cells between clues.
- Since (2,2) has already been visited and I am at (2,1), the move here doesn't contribute much but considering my position and the puzzle's progression, it seems like we have limited options.

I am currently at position (2,0), and I have filled 7 out of 9 cells in my path so far. My next move should be to visit clue number 3 or a cell that brings me closer to it. According to the board state, there are two available moves: (1,0). 

My goal is to find the optimal next step by considering each possible move and its implications.

EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE MOVES:

Option 1: Move from (2,0) to (1,0)
Pros:
- Gets me closer to clue number 3.
Cons:
- Doesn't fill an empty cell directly.
- Leaves my path somewhat fragmented.

Option 2: Other available moves aren't listed, so I can only evaluate the given option.

DECISION:
Considering the goal of moving towards clue number 3 and filling in any empty cells as needed, moving from (2,0) to (1,0) seems like a reasonable step. It aligns with the ascending order requirement for visiting clues, even if it doesn't directly fill an empty cell in this move.

MOVE: (1,0)

However, I will add one more consideration given the unique nature of the puzzle:
Looking ahead, I should also consider the overall flow and whether moving to (1,0) sets me up better for the next few moves. But with only two options provided and no further context beyond that, I must conclude based on immediate strategy rather than potential future implications.

Please let me know if this is a good move or if you need any adjustments!

I am currently at position (1,0) and have filled 8 out of 9 cells, with the last cell to fill being the one containing clue number 3. I need to visit clue number 2 next, which is located at position (2,2). However, since I'm already very close to my destination and there's only one empty cell between me and clue 2, it doesn't make sense to go through a long path just to get back to the starting point of clue 2.

Given that we are stuck with no available moves, let's analyze our current situation further. From (1,0), we can only move horizontally or vertically.

From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:33:09,441 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,0), having filled 8 out of 9 cells in my path so far. The next clue I need to visit is Clue 3, which is located at position (2,2). However, I'm stuck because there are no available next moves according to the rules.

To find a solution, let's analyze the situation further. Given that I have filled 8 out of 9 cells and need to end my path at the highest numbered clue (Clue 3), I can only place one more cell in the empty space below Clue 3 at position (2,1). The current board state shows that Clue 6 is already occupied by a filled cell. Since Clue 7 has to be placed before Clue 8, and considering there's an empty cell between them in the row above (i.e., between clue numbers 5 and 4), I need to revisit the path taken so far and find the best move that leads me closer to fulfilling these constraints.

Evaluating my options, moving from (1,0) to either (2,0), (0,2), or (1,2) seems reasonable. However, we must also ensure that there's enough space between clue numbers 5, 4, and the path ahead of me towards Clue 3.

MOVE: (2,0)

This choice allows me to revisit my previous moves and potentially open up a path for placing Clue 7 before moving towards Clue 8.

I am currently at position (1,0), and I have filled 8 out of 9 cells. My current path order is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (1,0). The highest numbered clue I haven't visited yet is 3. According to the rules, I need to visit all clues in ascending order, so my next target should be Clue 2 at position (2,2).

However, since we can only move horizontally or vertically and never revisit a cell, it seems that we are indeed "stuck" with no apparent next moves that would allow us to continue the path.

Upon closer inspection of the board state, I notice that there is one empty cell between Clue 1 at position (0,0) and our current position at (1,0). This could be an opportunity for backtracking or revisiting a previous part of the path. Specifically, we can move from (1,0) to (0,0), but since we've already been there and visited Clue 1, this seems like a dead end.

Considering the given board state and our current position at (1,0), I am struggling to find a logical next step that would allow us to continue filling the remaining cells in ascending order. It appears we have hit an impasse!

MOVE: Unfortunately, there are no available moves that meet the puzzle's constraints.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (1,0): This would take me out of the initial row and get me closer to Clue 3 at position (2,0). However, I need to visit Clue 2 first.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (0,1), which is Clue 2, and I have filled 2 out of 9 cells in a continuous path starting from Clue 1. The current situation is that the only unvisited clue left between my current location and the highest numbered clue (Clue 3) is Clue 3 itself at position (2,0).

STRATEGY:
Next, I need to visit Clue 3, which is located at position (2,0). However, I must do so in a way that allows me to fill all empty cells between clues and maintain the continuous path.

EVALUATION:
The available moves are (1,1) or (0,2).

- Moving to (1,1): This would put me one cell away from Clue 3 but still require an additional move to reach it. It also fills an essential cell in the middle row.
- Moving to (0,2): This puts me on the same column as Clue 3 but requires two moves horizontally afterward to visit Clue 3.

DECISION:
The best next move is (1,1). Although it takes one more step to reach Clue 3, it fills a critical cell in the middle row and sets up a straightforward path to Clue 3 from there.

I am currently at position (1,1), having already visited clues 1 and 2, and filled a total of 3 out of 9 cells. The next clue I need to visit in ascending order is Clue 3, which is located at position (2,0). To reach this goal efficiently, I should think about how to minimize backtracking and make progress towards the top-right corner of the board.

STRATEGY:
I must visit Clue 3 next. Since it's located at (2,0), my next move should ideally get me closer to this position without unnecessary detours.

EVALUATION: For each available move, I'll consider the pros and cons:

* Move (2,1): This move would put me directly above Clue 3 but is not a horizontal or vertical move, which is not allowed.
* Move (1,0): This move would get me closer to the bottom-left corner of the board, putting me one step away from Clue 3. However, it doesn't seem as optimal since I'm already at (1,1), and moving left might limit my future options.
* Move (1,2): Moving right does not help in reaching Clue 3 more efficiently.

DECISION:
The best move to make is (1,0) because it moves me closer to Clue 3 without any obstacles or backtracking issues. It keeps the path relatively open for further progression towards higher-numbered clues.

2025-12-10 13:34:06,443 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0), and my current situation is that I need to visit all remaining clues in ascending order while avoiding revisiting any cells. Clue 3 has already been visited, so the next clue to visit is Clue 4. According to the board state, Clue 4's location is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the provided coordinates for other clues and considering that I need to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order, it seems likely that the missing numbers are part of the puzzle solution.

Next, I need to determine the possible locations for Clue 4. The empty cells between Clues 1-2, 2-3, and the remaining empty cell at position (0,2) seem like potential candidates for Clue 4's location. However, since I have already visited all clues in ascending order so far, the next clue should be located after Clue 3.

Given that there are three empty cells and one of them is at position (1,1), which has been filled with a number not yet mentioned (it's likely part of the solution path to make it easier for me to decide where to move). Therefore, based on this analysis, I think I should aim to find Clue 4 at the remaining empty cell that hasn't been explicitly mentioned in the previous moves.

Next available clue numbers are 2 and 3. However, since 2 is not visited yet, it makes more sense to go for the next possible location of Clue 4 which seems to be (1,1).

STRATEGY: Since I need to fill all empty cells between clues as needed, visiting a clue that hasn't been explicitly mentioned in previous moves seems like an optimal choice. Given my current position and available options, aiming to move towards the remaining empty cell that can potentially hold Clue 4 is the best strategy.

EVALUATION:
Move (1,2) gets me closer to potential candidates for Clue 4's location but may not necessarily be a correct decision considering the constraints of visiting every clue exactly once in ascending order. On the other hand, moving to position (0,1), which has been explicitly mentioned as Clue 2's location, seems like an optimal choice since it aligns with the ascending order requirement.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis and evaluation, I decide to move towards Clue 2's known location at position (0,1).

On the other hand, moving to position (0,1), which has been explicitly mentioned as Clue 2's location, seems like an optimal choice since it aligns with the ascending order requirement.

DECISION:
Based on my analysis and evaluation, I decide to move towards Clue 2's known location at position (0,1).

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

1. ANALYSIS:
I am currently at position (2,0), which is also the location of Clue 3. I have already visited this clue and filled its associated cell with the number "3". According to the rules, I must visit all clue numbers in ascending order, so the next clue to visit should be Clue 2, located at position (0,1). As per the current game state, there are empty cells between the previously visited clues that need to be filled.

2. STRATEGY:
The next clue to visit is indeed Clue 2, which is situated at position (0,1).

3. EVALUATION:
I have two available moves from my current position (2,0): (2,1) or staying at the same cell.

- **Move (2,1)**: This move places me directly on top of Clue 2 but doesn't fill any empty cells between it and Clue 3. It is a straightforward move to visit Clue 2.

- **Staying at (2,0)**: Staying at the same cell fills an empty space between Clue 3 and other clues but does not bring me closer to visiting all clue numbers in ascending order.

4. DECISION:
The most efficient next step is to visit Clue 2 by moving directly above it. This move adheres strictly to the rules of visiting each clue number in ascending order and avoids unnecessary detours or revisiting cells that have already been filled.

2025-12-10 13:34:43,923 - INFO - THINKING:

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (2,1), which means I have visited Clue 3. My current path order is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1). Since the progress is 6/9 cells filled, I need to visit 3 more clues.

**STRATEGY:** My next task is to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. The current clue number sequence on the board is [ 1], [ 2],   . , which means Clue 4 and Clue 5 are missing from my path so far.

From the available moves, I can see that only one cell, (2,2), is not visited yet. Since I need to visit Clue 4 next, it should be located at position (1,0) or (0,0). Given that the highest numbered clue is already at position (2,0) and my current path sequence has [ 3], visiting Clue 4 at position (0,0) would disrupt the ascending order of clues.

However, I can fill in an empty cell between Clue 1 and Clue 2 as needed, which means Clue 4 could indeed be placed at position (0,0). So, my next clue to visit is actually Clue 4.

**EVALUATION:**

Available move options are:
- (0,0): Move back to the starting point
- (0,1): Backtrack and revisit a previously visited cell

The pros of moving to (0,0) include:
- Revisiting Clue 1 is not necessary as it's already filled in my path.
- I can fill an empty cell between Clues 1 and 2.

However, there are cons:
- This move doesn't bring me closer to the remaining clues or block any future paths.

The pros of moving to (0,1) include:
- Revisiting a previously visited cell (Clue 2) is not necessary as it's already filled in my path.

However, there are significant cons:
- Moving back to (0,1) after visiting Clue 3 at position (2,0) could lead to inefficiency and unnecessary path retracing if I don't fill empty cells between the clues accordingly.
 
**DECISION:** Considering that moving to (0,0) allows for filling an empty cell between Clues 1 and 2 as needed and keeping the ascending order of clues intact, it's a better move.

2025-12-10 13:34:43,936 - INFO - REASONING:
2025-12-10 13:34:43,936 - INFO - **ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (2,1), which means I have visited Clue 3. My current path order is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1). Since the progress is 6/9 cells filled, I need to visit 3 more clues.

**STRATEGY:** My next task is to visit the remaining clues in ascending order. The current clue number sequence on the board is [ 1], [ 2],   . , which means Clue 4 and Clue 5 are missing from my path so far.

From the available moves, I can see that only one cell, (2,2), is not visited yet. Since I need to visit Clue 4 next, it should be located at position (1,0) or (0,0). Given that the highest numbered clue is already at position (2,0) and my current path sequence has [ 3], visiting Clue 4 at position (0,0) would disrupt the ascending order of clues.

However, I can fill in an empty cell between Clue 1 and Clue 2 as needed, which means Clue 4 could indeed be placed at position (0,0). So, my next clue to visit is actually Clue 4.

**EVALUATION:**

Available move options are:
- (0,0): Move back to the starting point
- (0,1): Backtrack and revisit a previously visited cell

The pros of moving to (0,0) include:
- Revisiting Clue 1 is not necessary as it's already filled in my path.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:34:56,550 - INFO - THINKING:

1. ANALYSIS: I am currently at position (2,1), which means I have already visited Clue 3, and I need to continue visiting other clues in ascending order. The current path taken is as follows:
   (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1)
   
   Visiting all clue numbers in ascending order means I need to visit Clue 4 next. Since the current path doesn't include it, and my last known position was at Clue 3 before moving to (2,1), we need to determine which direction leads us closer to the rest of the board. 

   Next clue location is position (0,1). The current game state indicates that I'm close to reaching the top row.

2. STRATEGY: Given that the next necessary clue visit after Clue 3 is indeed Clue 4 at (0,1), and considering the visual representation of the board where only a few spaces are taken up so far – it's clear we need to backtrack slightly, as my current position (2,1) will not allow easy access to higher-numbered clues. 

   Now, looking at my available moves from (2,1): (0,0), and (2,2). We can see that moving back to the top-left corner of the board could potentially get me closer to reaching Clue 4 in a more efficient path.

3. EVALUATION: For each available move:
   A) Move to (2,2):
      - Pros: Fills an empty cell.
      - Cons: Doesn't bring us any closer to the next necessary clue (Clue 4 at position (0,1)). Also, this might limit our movement space later on.

   B) Move back to (0,0) is not possible as it was already visited and filled in the path taken previously.

4. DECISION: Given my current situation and available moves from (2,1), moving to (2,2) does fill an empty cell but doesn't bring me closer to my next necessary visit (Clue 4 at position (0,1)). However, it is one of our options for the time being.

However, upon re-reading the task and analyzing the board again - I see that we can actually move directly from (2,1) towards Clue 4.

I am currently at position (0,0), which is Clue 1. I have filled 1 out of 9 cells, and my goal is to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers. The next clue number I need to visit is 2.

STRATEGY:
Clue 2 is located at position (1,2). To reach this location efficiently, I should move towards the east or north direction from my current position.

EVALUATION:

Available moves: (1,0), (0,1)

 Pros and Cons for each move:

* Move to (1,0): This would be a horizontal move. It gets me closer to Clue 2, but it's not directly in the correct row.
* Move to (0,1): This would be a vertical move. However, moving up will require me to revisit or go around potential future clue locations.

DECISION:
Given that I need to visit Clue 2 next and my current position is (0,0), moving east towards (1,0) seems like the most direct and efficient next step. This choice doesn't block any paths back to my starting point or other potential clue locations yet and gets me closer to where Clue 2 is located.

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (1,1) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells in a continuous path. I need to visit the next clue number, which is Clue 2 located at (1,2). However, since I've already been to (1,2), I must find an alternative route that includes visiting all clues in ascending order.

My options are:
- Move to (0,1): This would take me away from my current goal of reaching Clue 2.
- Move to (2,1): This move takes me closer to the clue but doesn't visit any new cells beyond the current path. However, it does keep the path continuous and allows for future moves towards higher clues.
- Move to (1,2): Since I've already been here, revisiting this cell is not an option.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:
- Moving to (0,1) would mean going back on myself after visiting Clue 3, which is unnecessary and inefficient since we need to visit all cells in ascending order.
- Moving to (2,1) keeps the path continuous, doesn't revisit any cells, and brings us closer to the higher clues without creating dead ends or revisiting cells unnecessarily.

DECISION:
Given that I must follow the puzzle rules of visiting every cell exactly once and filling all 9 cells in one continuous path, moving to (2,1) is the best choice as it keeps our path continuous and allows for future moves towards reaching higher clues.

2025-12-10 13:35:30,819 - INFO - THINKING:

**ANALYSIS:** I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 4 out of 9 cells in a continuous path. My previous moves were from clue 1 at position (0,0), then to (1,0), then to (1,1), and finally to (2,1). So, my current situation is that I need to visit the remaining clues in ascending order.

**STRATEGY:** The next clue number I should visit is clue 3, which is located at position (1,1). Wait, this seems contradictory because we already visited (1,1) and it's not empty. However, we can still go through the process to see what options we have.

**EVALUATION:**

For each available move:
- Move to **(2,0):** Pros: We can go back to a previous row and potentially revisit a clue in ascending order or visit an empty cell. Cons: This might not bring us closer to clue 3.
- Move to **(2,2):** Pros: We are moving to a position that is directly connected to the current one, and we haven't explored all possibilities in this direction yet. Cons: Since (1,2) already has a clue number on it, visiting (2,2) might not be as direct towards reaching clue 3.

Considering these points, I think it's optimal to explore more moves from my current position before deciding which direction to move next, especially since we haven't placed any clues in the second row or column yet and moving directly to (2,2) doesn't get us closer to a necessary clue for our ascending order requirement.

However, upon reevaluation of available options considering the need to visit all cells and follow the order of clue numbers, moving diagonally would be optimal because it involves visiting empty spaces while maintaining the path's continuity. Since we are at position (2,1) and cannot move left or right due to existing clues and our path being continuous from a single start point, considering all constraints I will choose a direction that might not seem like an immediate choice but is necessary for exploring possible paths in zip puzzles.

MOVE: (2,0)

This decision is based on the need to explore the board fully and consider the entire puzzle's requirements.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

2025-12-10 13:35:52,828 - INFO - THINKING:
I am currently at position (2,0), which is one of the corner cells. I have filled 5 out of 9 cells and need to continue my path in a way that visits all clue numbers in ascending order. The current board state shows that I've already visited clues 1, 3, but not clue 2 yet. My goal is to find the next move to reach clue 2 at position (1,2). Since there are no available moves listed, it seems like I'm stuck.

STRATEGY:
I need to visit clue 2 next because it's the only unvisited clue between the current highest visited clue number and the next required clue number in ascending order. The only possible move is to go back to an already visited cell or try to reach a nearby empty cell that could potentially be part of my path.

EVALUATION:
Since I'm stuck, let me re-examine my options from the last known position. One option is to move up to (1,0), which would allow me to revisit a previously visited cell and continue along the row. However, it seems like there's a better approach: moving diagonally down-right to (2,2) would be an option if I wanted to go further away from clue 2.

DECISION:
However, given that clue 2 is at position (1,2), moving diagonally up-left to the cell above clue 3, which is already visited, doesn't make sense as a viable path. The best approach seems to be to backtrack slightly and move up to (1,0) to get closer to clue 2.

I am currently at position (2,2) and have filled 1 out of 9 cells. The goal is to visit every cell exactly once in ascending order of clue numbers. I need to visit clue number 2 next, which is located at position (0,2). Since the current path taken is (2,2), I can move one step down or one step left.

EVALUATION:

1. Move to (2,1): This would take me in a horizontal direction towards clue 3, but it doesn't get me any closer to visiting clue number 2.
2. Move to (1,2): This would allow me to move in the vertical direction down from clue number 1 to potentially fill an empty cell or reach a location that is closer to clue number 2.

DECISION:
Moving down to position (1,2) makes sense because it sets up the possibility of visiting clue number 2 on the next step and allows for additional flexibility in navigating the board while adhering to the rules.

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

1. Moving to (1,2) would not bring me any closer to Clue 2 and doesn't seem optimal.

DECISION:
Considering the available options, moving to (2,1) seems like the best choice. It sets up a clear path towards Clue 2 and prepares me for the next move in the sequence.

I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2.

I am currently at position (2,1) and have filled 2 out of 9 cells with a path order of 4 -> 3 -> 2. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 3 next, which is not located yet. My goal is to find a way to fill all 9 cells in one continuous path.

STRATEGY:
The next clue number I should visit is indeed Clue 3. However, I must consider its location first. Unfortunately, there is no direct information about the current position of Clue 3, but we can infer that it is likely located somewhere on or around the path we're taking.

EVALUATION:
For each available move, let's analyze the pros and cons:

**Move (1,1)**: Pros - Gets me closer to potentially finding Clue 3. Cons - Doesn't seem immediately relevant to clue 2.

**Move (2,0)**: Pros - Allows me to visit a new part of the board that might lead to Clue 3 or other clues. Cons - Might not be directly useful for visiting Clue 3 right away.

DECISION:
Considering my current position and available moves, I will choose **(1,1)** as it allows me to maintain some flexibility in navigating towards clue 2's general direction (0,2) while also keeping an open path. This move might lead to a discovery of Clue 3 or create opportunities for future moves.

I am currently at position (1,1) with a path taken of (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1), which means I've already visited clue 1 and partially filled in the path. The current board state is:

  .    .    4 
  2  [ 3]   3 
  .  [ 2] [ 1]

From my analysis of the available moves (0,1), (1,0), or (1,2), I need to consider which one will allow me to proceed with visiting clue 2 next. Clue 2 is located at position (0,2).

EVALUATION:
For each available move:

* Moving to (0,1) would require going down a row and then left, but it doesn't necessarily get me closer to clue 2 since I'd be moving away from the column where clue 2 is.
* Moving to (1,0) gets me one step to the left and closer to potentially accessing the top row, which could help in planning my path forward. However, this move might not put me directly on track for visiting clue 2 immediately after.
* Moving to (1,2) would allow me to continue filling in cells that I've already visited, but it doesn't bring me any closer to clue 2.

STRATEGY:
Given the options and my current position at (1,1), visiting clue 2 next makes sense since it is the lowest unvisited clue so far. The next best move after visiting a clue should be one that gets me closer or more aligned with the next clue in order.

DECISION:
Considering I need to visit clue 2 next and my goal is to fill in all cells efficiently, moving down from (1,1) to (2,1) would put me directly adjacent to clue 2 at position (0,2). However, this isn't an available move. Among the given choices, moving left to (1,0) seems most promising as it aligns me with a potential future path and doesn't immediately block any necessary moves for accessing higher clues.

I am currently at position (2,0), and I have filled 5 out of 9 cells in a continuous path. My current situation is that I'm stuck with no available next moves, but I can see that I need to visit clue 3, which is not shown on the board yet.

To proceed, I should try to visit the next clue number after 2, which would be clue 3. However, its location is unknown. But I know that it must be somewhere in a cell adjacent to an already visited cell (since we're dealing with a path-finding puzzle where you have to visit all cells exactly once).

From my current position (2,0), I can see two empty cells: one at (1,0) and the other at (2,1). Since I've already been to the cell (1,0) in my previous path, I need to find another way. Therefore, I will try to visit the cell at (2,1).

STRATEGY:
I should visit clue 3 next, but since its location is unknown, I'll aim for a position where it's likely to be. The only possible place left would be adjacent to my current position or to an empty space that has not been visited yet.

EVALUATION:
From (2,0), the following moves could potentially lead me closer to clue 3:

* Move to (1,0): This move is a possibility since I can then check for any possible locations of clue 3. However, it's likely that this path would be blocked or not feasible.
* Move to (2,1): This seems like the best option as it allows me to visit an empty cell adjacent to my current position.

DECISION:
The most logical move is to go to (2,1). It opens up new possibilities and increases the chances of finding clue 3 without getting stuck again.

I should visit clue 3 next, but since its location is unknown, I'll aim for a position where it's likely to be. The only possible place left would be adjacent to my current position or to an empty space that has not been visited yet.

EVALUATION:
From (2,0), the following moves could potentially lead me closer to clue 3:

* Move to (1,0): This move is a possibility since I can then check for any possible locations of clue 3. However, it's likely that this path would be blocked or not feasible.
* Move to (2,1): This seems like the best option as it allows me to visit an empty cell adjacent to my current position.

DECISION:
The most logical move is to go to (2,1). It opens up new possibilities and increases the chances of finding clue 3 without getting stuck again.

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

I am currently at position (2,0) and have filled 5 out of 9 cells. I've already visited clue 1 at position (2,2), so my next goal is to visit clue 2, which is located at position (0,2). However, since we are playing a ZIP PUZZLE, we need to fill all the empty cells between clues in ascending order.

First, let's analyze our current board state and find any potential moves. Our path taken so far is: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). We have 3 and 5 already filled in the upper-left corner.

Looking at the clues and our current position, we need to move left or up. However, since we are stuck, let's evaluate the pros and cons of each available move:

- Moving up: (2,0) -> (1,0)
  Pros: Gets us closer to clue 2.
  Cons: May create a dead end if we can't move further.

- Moving left: (2,0) -> (2,-1) is not possible since our board size is 3x3 and (-1) would be out of bounds. However, moving left one cell in the current row is feasible but does not seem optimal as it doesn't directly lead to clue 2.

- Since we can't move up or left effectively without potential dead ends, let's consider visiting a higher-numbered clue indirectly by filling empty cells between clues.

Given our constraints and the need to fill all 9 cells in ascending order, I'll choose a move that allows us to progress through the board while keeping an eye on the overall strategy.

MOVE: (2,1)

This choice aims to create space for future moves and keep us moving closer to clue 2.

I am currently at position (2,0), which is already filled with a path number '5'. According to the current game state, I have filled 5 out of 9 cells and need to visit all clue numbers in ascending order. Clue 1 was visited first at position (2,2) and clue 2 needs to be visited next.

My objective is to reach clue 2 at position (0,2). From my current position (2,0), I can move either horizontally or vertically to an adjacent empty cell. 

Available moves are:

* Move to the left: (1,0)
* Move down: (3,0) - not possible since it's out of bounds
* Move up: not possible since I'm already at the top row
* Move right: (2,1)

I will evaluate each move for its pros and cons.

EVALUATION:
If I move to the left to position (1,0), I'll be getting closer to clue 2 but still have to cover more ground. However, moving to this cell might create a possibility of revisiting a path I already took if I need to backtrack later. 

Moving down or up is not possible.

Moving right to (2,1) would put me on the same column as the current leftmost path and could lead to an easier next move towards clue 2, but it doesn't directly get me closer.

DECISION:
Considering my goal to reach clue 2 at position (0,2), I should choose a move that gets me closer while minimizing backtracking possibilities. Moving right to position (2,1) provides the best immediate chance for an easy next step towards clue 2 without committing to a potentially more complex path.
