[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form

2025-12-10 16:11:38,207 - INFO - You are solving a ZIP PUZZLE. This is a path-finding puzzle where you must visit every cell exactly once.

=== PUZZLE RULES ===
1. Fill ALL 9 cells in one continuous path
2. Start at clue number 1
3. Visit ALL clue numbers in ascending order: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ... -> highest
4. End your path at the highest numbered clue
5. Move only horizontally or vertically (NO diagonal moves)
6. Never revisit a cell you've already been to
7. Fill empty cells between clues as needed

=== BOARD INFORMATION ===
Board Size: 3x3
Coordinate System: Each position is (row, column) starting from (0,0)

Coordinate Grid:
(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)

=== CLUE LOCATIONS ===
Clue 1: position (2,0)
Clue 2: position (2,1)

=== CURRENT GAME STATE ===
Progress: 1/9 cells filled
Current Position: (2,0)
Path Taken: (2,0)

  .    3    . 
[ 1]   2    . 
Legend: [1],[2],etc = your path order | 1,2,etc = clue numbers | . = empty cell

=== YOUR TASK ===
Available Next Moves: (1,0), (2,1)

THINK STEP BY STEP AND EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING:

1. ANALYSIS: Where am I now and what's my current situation?

2. STRATEGY: What clue number should I visit next? Where is it located?

3. EVALUATION: For each available move, what are the pros and cons?

4. DECISION: Which move is best and why?

Provide your reasoning in the following format:

THINKING:
[Your detailed analysis here]

MOVE: (row,col)

Example response:
THINKING:
I am currently at position (1,2) and have filled 3 out of 9 cells. Looking at the clues, I need to visit clue 2 next, which is at position (2,1). From my current position, I can move to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), or (2,2). The move to (1,1) gets me closer to clue 2 and doesn't block any future paths. Moving to (1,3) would take me away from clue 2. Therefore, (1,1) is the optimal choice.

MOVE: (1,1)

Solve the puzzle step by step, providing your THINKING and MOVE each time. Remember to consider future implications of your current move on completing the entire puzzle. You must returen your move in coordinate system (row, column). and it only have positive co-ordinates similar to the Matrix form
